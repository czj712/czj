I don't really like shirts tight across my stomach, and would have ordered a large but I think it would be too big.  This shirt is very warm, soft, silky.  I wish it was a tad longer, I bought two of these shirts one in the royal blue and one in the black.  I am writing one review for both shirts.<br /><br />So I have a 15yo who, due to circumstances beyond his control (i.e. an extremely sleepy metabolism even with medication), wears larger than he should adult clothing.  it has been extremely difficult to find street clothes and swim clothes which fit properly.

Her inspiration is drawn from &#34;games, movies and books&#34;. This helped pull me in right away.

It is rare that an author grabs your attention from the first word which is exactly what Ms. Rinyu does with this beautiful story.<br /><br />Kat and Julian are both doctors and meet in Africa while volunteering and caring for ill children. The story covers a 6 year period and I don't want to give away any of the story as the reader needs to experience it wit, Whenever Beth Rinyu releases a book I one click. I have been a fan after reading her first book The Exception to the The Rule which left me with a book hangover for weeks. I can say the same thing about A Cry for Hope.  She has done it again. The characters are so real and raw. You will cry, laugh and cry again.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and cannot wait for her next release!!!'\nWhat is the user profile of consumer AH6NG6DY7LCO467BN5JZTJUZUD7A inferring from the comments ?\n1.

It is also noted for the source of the word &#34;grok&#34; which Heinlein used to express the idea of knowing something completely .  It was three times as long as the average book of its day.  Today, 400-500 page books are the norm.  The story of Valentine Michael Smith, the Man from Mars, is now a classic and deservedly so.<br />, Although the book started a bit slowly and was taking place in an alternative history it eventually became an awe-inducing adventure ride into future realms of science.  Oh yeah, I liked it!<br /><br />It is actually a sequel to Arthur C Clarke's award winning novella, &#34;A Meeting With Medusa&#34;, but you don't really need to read this story.  In addition to the sentient Medusae within Jupiter's upper atmosphere we also encounter sentient chimps, sentient Machines, and another sentient race '\nWhat is the user profile of consumer AGN46J3LKBK5FKG6XATPJ3AUGUYA inferring from the comments ?\n1.

Truthfully, I didn't look at the dimensions when I bought it.  It really fills a persons back pocket so think about that before you buy it.  However, this is a really nice leather wallet.

Yes they and all mats like this look a bit industrial- but with kids in and out and wanting to keep the vehicle interior in good shape is ok by me., The design should have been cut around the lever., These bars look great as a replacement of the stock equipment.

If you are completely unfamiliar with the Cassie/Dory-Verse I would advise reading a few other books first because this short is (thankfully) absent of backstory and would probably be an odd place to jump in.<br />The plot basically boils down to one long chase scene with lots of action, flaring tempers, and a few cute one liners.

Great layers of protection in a comfortable cloth mask. Just what he wanted., I wear an 8 but ordered 8.5 as the reviews suggested. I didn't care for the material and didn't want to take my chances of not wearing them. Delivery was great, packaged very well. I had to return them, and the return was easy. I did like the padding in the shoe, many flats have no support at all but these do! I liked the little metal piece near the back of the shoe. It just was all around, not my taste., Ordered this shirt for a new teacher t-shirt look and I absolutely love it! It is super cute, stylish, soft, and fits perfectly.

I sent mine back., Good material, good cut, good fit, attractive color combination and all that for less than $40.  Imagine that!  It comes in two colors... the darker one is definitely one to avoid as it washes out and fades much faster than the white.  Dirty you say?  One cycle in the washing machine on a gentle cycle and voila, your white cap is back to its original color., The bracelet has a wow factor appreciated by a lot of people.  Wearing it alone or combined with other items, it attracts the attention of most.  A great conversation piece as well. For the price I think it’s a great buy and a useful one for more than the purpose for which it was designed, The scarf feels very soft and the size is perfect for men. For women it would be more a shawl. It feels like viscose does and keeps you warm. Wearing it with the reverse crossover, the slip-thru or traditional, it looks good. The frayed edge on one side adds a touch of progressive modern, Let's face it, we men don't have a wide range of accessories to complete a certain look or our personality.

I got it the other day and the first thing I notice, it's very bulky. No big deal I thought bigger the better. I the was going to charge it. Doesn't use the latest \"C\" cable, uses the old one. Doesn't even come with a wall charger. We'll anyway, a week later my brother called me that his van was dead, not cranking at all. Took the Noco 2000 amp to his house. Took it out of the bag/pouch and it was already turned on. I must of touched the powe, I had a bucking/studdering problem on my 2003 Ford Crown Victoria. It was kind of a slight miss. This only happened when I was in cruising mode. The car started great, idled great and accelerated great. Except for that pesky problem that was driving me crazy. That slight missing and studdering and bucking only when at steady speed. It was going on for months. Only problem was, the car didn't have a check engine light. Finally I had had enough of this problem. The coils on my car were the stock 9, I bought the Magnaflow 93200 direct fit catalytic converters for my 2003 Pontiac Vibe. Everything was direct fit. the flange bolted easily with a new gasket installed. Only one little problem. When I tried to put the ends of the pipes together to clamp them, the Magnaflow end was too narrow and would not go over the stock pipe. I worked it and wiggled it in for about an hour. Magnaflow should open up the end of the pipe a little more so it can slide easily over the stock pipe., The first time I tried this mirror, it caused bad eye strain and my head started hurting. I'll tell you why. I'm driving down the road and trying to figure out this mirror. All the objects seem far away so don't know how the cars behind you are far or close. It's curved convex so everything appears far away. Not for me, thanks anyway., This mirror is perfect, it's flat, what you see is what you get, no panoramic, no distortion, objects appear exactly how you view them. It doesn't cause eye strain or headaches like other mirrors. Clips on easily and has a light blue tint to reduce night time glare. I bought this one for my 2008 Lincoln Town Car, I will be buying a second one for my other car.

I will say the remastering was good on this<br />set but some songs did sound a little harsh., I have to keep it real!  This is not a good remaster.  Sounds like a vinyl source was used. It's unfortunate<br />because this my 3rd favorite Dells Cadet album.  However, this and many of their early albums for Cadet<br />have never been re-issued so, it will do for now.'\nWhat is the user profile of consumer AEEJOJWNPVCS46BMCWGLT4KRYHGQ inferring from the comments ?\n1.

You just wanted to keep reading to find out the ending of the story. It was sad when Josie lost someone who help a special place in her heart.  Would recommend this book. Love author Lisa Regan Books., This book was so slow in starting out. About three quarters of the way it picked up. It was ok to read but a little boring., You never amaze me how you can make seem there are two separate case and get it is not in the end. So many twist and turns in the whole to keep you guess until the end. The book left a big cliff hanger. So I hope there is more books in the series. Great work to the author. Keep them coming!!!, Wow, what a great book. I was screaming to not to get in that can with stranger. This book was suspenseful and scary. He loved watch death. The characters working on the case worked well together. It was amazing how things were missed an a girl hung on so long and could have been found if the had played attention to the little things. Would deck and look for another book with these characters., Could not put this book down. I read the complete series in 5 days. You must read the first two books to get the complete trials of Chief Josie Quinn. The only think I wished was there be another book to this series. I read the end ans wanted to know so much more about the Chief. It keeps you guess all the way through the book. The end was a surprise for sure.  Author Lisa Regan, please write more on Josie Quinn. Would definitely recommend this series.'\nWhat is the user profile of consumer AHDOR7JXUMGVUAHKMFFRFCYPEU4A inferring from the comments ?\n1.

I primarily purchased to use with crochet items to add features, eyes, etc.  They are pretty uniformly sized - I only came across a couple of beads that were wonky or misshapen.<br /><br />The extras in the kit are helpful as well.  The bead needle came in very handy and made application so much easier.  Nice kit overall for the pricing!, I used these to add to a crochet bag I made.  Great quality and just the right size.  It's nice they came in a set of 4, so I can make other bags in the future., This is a pretty nice set of grommets.

My only complaint is that there are no Kanji/furigana in it--hiragana alone makes things a little more difficult to read if you're not great at Japanese because there are no spaces between words., I actually picked this book up at the library when it was \"E\" week at my little 3.5 year old's preschool.

I love the labeling of each port on the bottom of the product. I did want to note that this does not do video passthrough from USB-C Video on the source laptop to USB-C Video output from the dock to the monitor. The description did not explicitly state that this would be supported, but I was hopeful nonetheless. Not a disappointment as this was a longshot for me.  The other output ports work exactly as described (we are using USB C with Video from the Laptop to dock, Best mag mount CB antenna I've ever owned. Well constructed, and incredibly low SWR out of the box. Had to trim about 1/16\" to get it down to 1.2 SWR. Do note that the steel antenna element is incredibly hardened (this is a good thing) but makes it difficult to cut for trimming. I utilized a bolt cutter, or alternatively a grinder, to trim it down for a more precise SWR response., Planning to purchase a 2nd one. Incredibly well engineered. Love the built in SWR meter with audio feedback for easy antenna tuning. This transceiver blows away anything else I have ever used.'\nWhat is the user profile of consumer AG7I5EOLG7EIVEROWFWWT6YIGVRA inferring from the comments ?\n1.

That is what happened when I ordered this dress.  I ordered this after reading reviews, comparing sizes, etc.  The dress fit fine, albeit a little loose, but I have never looked so much like a nun in my life.  Remember Sister Mary Robert from Sister Act?  She wasn't quite in the full getup?  Well, this would be a perfect dress for that costu, I really love this shirt.  I’ve worn it many times throughout the last year and it has kept its gorgeous shape, feel and deep color.  It’s soft and looks great untucked or tucked in as it is not too boxy.<br /><br />I bought a Large...I am 5’9”, 165lbs and a 36DD.  I wish they had this in more colors!!, Update:  this thing shrank after the first COLD wash and air dry.  Now my ladies hang out.  Bumped it down to 1 Star.<br /><br />I haven’t had a sports bra that fit right since oh.... 10 years ago when I was thinner, more fit and didn’t have babies.<br /><br />Fast forward 10 years and I have changed a lot.  I was really hoping that this bra would be amazing and for the most part, it is.  However, it is super hard to get over my breasts when putting it on.<br /><br />Once on, it doesn’t move aro, Okay y’all.  These pants are hilarious.  I wish I had recorded the unveiling, because the separation of one leg from the other when opening the package was LOUD.  Like I was peeling apart two giant, static-filled pieces of plastic.<br /><br />Another missed opportunity: when walking in them.  Remember those “swishy pants” from the 90s that all of us Tomboys wore?  Yeah, that’s what they sounded like.  You could hear me coming down the hall for sure.  I tried recording the sound of me walking, bu, Update: this comes a bit after receiving two Marycrafts dresses because I just kept forgetting to update!  I have worn both just a handful of times yet they already have tear along the seam by the zipper.  These are in no way too tight, but somehow developed tears in the seam in weird locations.  I wanted to buy more to replace but I’m afraid to keep spending money since it happened not once, but twice and I am outside of the return window. Cute dresses but not worth it when they do this.<br /><'\nWhat is the user profile of consumer AEB2IZPV277XT3X4SPT3H5OQW54Q inferring from the comments ?\n1.

This book gave me life. The two main characters are over 40 and are not playing games. They admit what they want and go for it. Makeba knows what Blaze is and tries to stay away from him, but the heart wants what it wants. Blaze has made no qualms about wanting her and he says he’ll pursue her and OMG he does. There’s nothing like a grown a** man doing grown man stuff to get his woman. When troubl, This is one of those books that just had me talking to it, laughing and really bonding with the characters. Sure, there are some mistakes but you read past them because the story captures you. Savannah is so relatable and likable. A true survivor and warrior. Joshua is that Alpha that other alphas respect.  He loves Savvy and he’s not afraid to show it and prove it. The transparency they both exhibit is touching. His brothers are supportive and protective (they all need their own stories). Peter, Two very good chapters and then blank pages. Purchased this book and still waiting for the update. Loved the series, but I think this is the last one I’ll attempt to read., I knew this book would be good, but I wasn’t prepared for how much I would enjoy it. I’ve read quite a few books by the author and have enjoyed them all. She did not disappoint with this release. Magic and animal shifters in their true forms. Magical kingdom, powerful lion king and a fated night. Gainde and Linguere are definitely lovable. The spicy scenes were definitely spicy, but the way they were written was like reading a romantic love letter. It’s a bit of star-crossed lovers and “let me d, Baby brother did not come to play. Ryan understood the assignment and executed it to perfection. This was definitely very sweet and the spice level was high. Malika is the perfect PA and Ryan is the boss you love working for. However, love has its own agenda and is using a Bucket List to reach it. Ryan is that Alpha in charge and Malika is his desire. Once she gets over her shyness(embarrassment) she relates, relaxes, releases and loves. This book definitely had me smiling.'\nWhat is the user profile of consumer AH3MUJK7RLPXR43ZABG7QLSUV3YQ inferring from the comments ?\n1.
