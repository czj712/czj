I have one in the motor home and given some to the adult children.  I have had no problem with solid things.  It is not designed for onions.  a hand chopper or small food processor is great for onions. I do it all with a sharp knife in seconds.  Very soft cheese would never work even on a hand grater.  If you can't grate it on a hand grater the machine will not do it.  Onions are slime and they will not work.  I use it for shredding cheese, potato's all the time.  I can shop carrots so fast that it does not pay to get out the shooter.  If you want fancy cuts it is great.  I can use knives very well and keep them razor sharp.  I would never be without one.  I use it several times a week.  It is one of the few kitchen gadgets that I would not be without.  I read all the bad reviews.  They were a hoot.  Not so bright club.  They don't melt in the dishwasher unless you let them slip to the bottom and touch the heating element.  After 35 years of being cleaned in the dish washer I have never had any kind of problem.  For all the things people can't get it to do learn to use a knife but I am not sure you will be safe.  LOL"

    "output": "Omega J8003 masticating juicer: I absolutely love the Omega brand! It is truly a great masticating juicer, so versatile. I not only juice veggies with it, I also make nut butters (cashew, almonds, sunflower seeds, without the additives in store bought butters like regular table salt, I use only sea salt which has trace minerals, and I also soak the nuts overnight, with 1 tbs lemon juice per 1 c seeds to remove enzyme inhibitors which prevent nutrient absorption in the body), and I make my own pasta from organic gluten free buckwheat flour.Although I love the Omega brand, my experience with buying a used machine from a private seller here on Amazon, didn't turn out to be a great financial deal for me. It came without the necessary plunger and other tools which I had to order from the Omega company, and also pay for shipping.The machine warranty is 10 years but my used machine didn't come with the necessary documents. It is 7 years old. If you are going to get a juicer, save money and buy a new one, that's my advise!A masticating juicer is better than a centrifugal one, b/c a  masticating juicer works slowly, making sure it doesn't heat up the foods and destroys the enzymes. A centrifugal juicer destroys enzymes, rendering the juice nutritionally quite worthless.We all should take a better care of our health and drink more green juices, veggie smoothies, eat salads, grow sprouts on your kitchen counter or windowsill, and give up meat, eggs, dairy, sugar, gluten and soy, all leading to degenerative diseases. We should use organic produce, either grow our own or join a local CSA. We either pay a little more for organic food now or pay the doctors and hospital bills later. We do have a choice. It is a question of educating ourselves, making sure our kids and grand kids have a future with their health intact. I am serious! Just look around... doesn't almost everybody you know suffer from some kind of health problem? We are what we eat! Start today saving yourself, google or search youtube for raw and vegan recipes and health advise. It's all out there! Help yourself! Be healthy, be happy! Good luck!It has been 6 weeks since I bought the used Omega juicer. I couldn't use it right away, I had to order the missing parts, the plunger being one of them and wait for delivery. Now after ca 4 weeks of juicing the machine doesn't want to start, I have to take it apart and put it together several times and pray it will start, with all veggies being cut and waiting to be juiced. It looks like I will have to buy another juicer and this time it will be a brand new one, with warranty! I have never bought a used kitchen appliance before and never will again. Never the less, I still love this brand and I will buy a new Omega. This Omega model has 10 years warranty, this particular machine is 7 years old but b/c I bought it used, it didn't come with the necessary documents for me to ask the Omega company to have it serviced for free. I contacted the Amazon seller asking if I can return it. The answer was that they take merchandise back within 30 days of purchase and it has been longer than that. They advised me to sell it for parts. Again, do not buy used stuff, you never know what you will get."

(My previous rice cooker was a cheap brand and it cooked rice in 20 minutes, but the no matter how I altered the water ratio, the rice never came out perfect.  It was either too mushy or too hard (usually a combination of both), and while it cooked, it always spit out rice water through the vent in the lid, resulting in a bit of a mess on my counter and underneath my cabinets.)  I have cooked between 1-4 cups of uncooked rice and each time it cooks perfectly and while steam comes out through the vent on the top, there's no rice water spitting out.  The rice cooker is easy to wipe clean on the outside.  It really is nice to pop the rice in, hit a button and then I can forget about it for an hour.

Now I have to go buy a new one!...  i noticed a smell of burn the last 4 times I used it.  I thought kernel husk was getting too hot.  I didnt smell this before.  Tiday, i smelled the burn and then it stopped working.  This thing sucks!!My first air popper.  This unit, I expected a turn on/off button... no button.  The butter tray is useless.  Its more for controling amount of kernal going into unit.  The discharge could be a little better designed.  You will need a really large, wide bowl to catch the popcorn.  The corn will fly all over near the end of cycle.  Also!!  The kernals are so hot and some will end up in your bowl heated and reafy to blow.  And will pop inside your bowl sending other corn to spray on to the floor and other places.  Just be ready with a broom.  Its ok because they arent greasy so easy clean up.I still like it.  I use it far more than I ever intended on using it."

Plus the internal bowl is nice quality and easy to clean with the non-stick surface.  The only downside is that after keeping warm for 70 hours, the rice is no longer fluffy and moist, but hey- it is still edible and can be used for fried rice."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Open new vistas in cooking: I like you always thought that a rice cooker was another kitchen toy that would be used once and then hidden in a cupboard somewhere never to be used again. Well was I ever wrong. I took a sushi cooking class in January that got me interested in other brands of rice other than just Uncle Bens long grain rice.  I noticed how good the rice was an how they prepared it using a rice cooker. I then read a number of reviews about rice cookers and found that there are simple ones that can be used for steaming as well as rice cooking and then there was the more expensive kind that only did rice and other cereals.  In the later group is further broken down into fuzzy rice cooker, induction fuzzy rice cookers and pressure induction fuzzy rice cookers. As you can guess the prices continues to go up as you add more bells in wisseles. I decided on this model because it gave me the minimum set of features I was looking for.  The last time I was as happy with a purchase like this is when I bought my first ipod touch. The user interface could not be simpler. Using there cup you measure the amount of rice you want to cook, wash it and then put it in the rice pot in the cooker. The inside of the rice pot has a measuring lable that shows you how much water to add. Then place the rice pot in the cooker, close the lid and press the menu button that IDs the kind of rice you are cooking.  Next you have two choices do I want the rice cook now or some time in the future. For now push the cook button and your done.  If you want it some time in the future you push the time button. The first time you use it you have to use the up and down arrows on the front to select the time you want the rice done. It uses military time. So if you want the rice done at 5:00 pm you would enter 17:00 on the display. The cooker remembers the time you set, so from then on all you have to do is press the time button it will come up 17:00. Next you press the cook button and your done. The nice think is that the rice cooker nows how long to cook the rice you selected and in the case of using the timer it nows when to start cooking to have it done on the time you selected. This acts as an aroma timer for me. When I smell the rice cooking I now it's time to start dinner. When this rice is done cooking a cheerful tune is played and the cooker is switched to the keep warm mode. Depending the kind of rice your cooking it can stay in this mode for several hours. This works out great because the rice comes out perfectly cooked when every your done cooking the rest of the meal. Cleanup could not be easier. I take the rice bowl fill it full of hot water and gently wipe it out with a sponge. It has a non stick service so it comes clean with little effort. Next you take the lid off and wipe as well and your done. When I think about cooking rice in a pot on the stove and the amount of work I went through timing and watching the rice cook followed by cleaning the pot.  If I over cooked the rice then I remember what a pain it was to clean the pot and how bad the rice tasted.Both these problems are either eliminated or greatly reduced.  If your like me you just think about the number of meals you currently make that requires rice. Since it was such a pain to work with you probably did not explore all the different kinds of recipes that are enhance by using different types of rice. With this rice cooker it's easy. The cooker itself does not take up that much counter space. I leave mine out on the counter all the time. I found that I used the cooker for both breakfast and dinner. For breakfast I make old fashion Grits for my wife. You put in 1/4 cup of grits and 1 1/4 cups of water, select porridge using the menu button and then hit the cook button and your done. After the Grits are done I open the lid and put in two slices of Velveeta a cheese on the top close the lid and let it stand for about a minute. The cheese melts into the Grits. You stir it a little using the paddle that came with the rice cooker pour it into a bowl and your done. Does she love it. I make steel cut oatmeal for myself and it always comes out great. In both cases you don't have to baby sit the unit it does all the work for you.  You may wonder why I only gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5. Well the one thing that is missing on this unit is a back light for the display. It makes it hard to read in limited light conditions. Other than that there is nothing to not like about this rice cooker."

I wanted to wait till after I had made quite a bit of rice before I made a review, and now I'm here to tell you, this thing SLAPS. NEVER in my LIFE have I had the pleasure of having rice so consistently perfect, everytime I hit a switch. It's stupid how easy this makes the process, and that's not even mentioning that it keeps the rice warm inside for almost the whole day(as long as you pull the rice into the middle so it doesn't dry out)! And I didn't even mention the water lines!!!! So nice to never worry if I've put the right amount of water in, just wash your rice, throw it in, and fill water up to the line that fits how many cups of rice and what type you put in. This machine changed my life style from eating rice maybe once a week if that, to me being in the mood to have rice any day of the week. I now will make a few cups of rice, take what I want, and leave the rest for other meals throughout the day. Total game changer, and if you've been looking for a sign, this is it."

You must buy The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook, by Hensperger/Kaufman to get the most out it.2 notes:- When cooking Brown Basmati rice, use the \"seim-brown rice\" water level and cooking timer - not the Brown rice setting.- When making risottos or any other recipe that requires you to saute onions, etc., in the bowl before adding the rice, you have to take the bowl out of the rice cooker for maybe a minute to let the cooker cool before you can close the lid and let it cook. Make sure to use the \"Quick Cook\" setting for sauteing onions, spices, etc. - it heats up and cooks faster.I love this machine and cookbook.  We're vegetarian and making 1- dish, delicious, easily-put-together meals is a God-send.  Setting up before I go to bed and having porridge or breakfast rice ready whenever I ask it to be is remarkable."

Tasted perfectly cooked (almost sticky rice quality!), not under cooked like most cookers make it. The rice cooker is just pretty. Unlike most rice cookers it is easy to clean. Which if you’ve ever owned a rice cooker they almost alway sit with rice and is a bug attractor even in their cleanest state. Its retractable cord is AMAZING. Those two features are the biggest sell. I can go on forever about this thing. I love it. Best purchase for a rice lover ever!!"

It also does a good job of keeping the rice warm, and it is very easy to remove and wash the inner lid along with the rice cooking pot, which is a big improvement on our previous rice cooker. We have cooked takikomi gohan in this rice cooker and it also came out great. The only minor quibble I have with this rice cooker so far is that the buttons are quite hard to press without also moving the whole rice cooker, and the button labels were slightly confusing so I had to read the (quite well written) instructions before using it."

    "output": "Not really good for more than one cup of brown rice: I decided to buy this because I really suck at making brown rice. White rice, any variety, I'm a champ. But I decided I wanted to get more fiber and eat healthier and thought eating more brown rice sounded like a good idea, but cooking it on the stove, I've had mixed luck. When you're cooking something for almost an hour on the stove, there are a lot of variables that can mess up your \"cook this for X minutes\" recipe.I bought this because I wanted something small and relatively inexpensive and importantly, foolproof. I did some research on how rice cookers work. Basically, they boil at  water at 100 C/212 F and then wait for the water to evaporate enough to get past that temperature. Once it's just barely past boiling (which it won't get until enough of the water is absorbed/evaporated), then the rice, in theory, should be done.The first batch of white rice I made, I did the exact measurements in the manual for 1 cup of dry rice. I used Jasmine. It was honestly perfect. Better than any stove rice I've managed to make, which surprised me, because I thought white rice on the stove was pretty easy/foolproof.Today, I decided to try brown rice. Since it's not just a trial run, I'm actually making food for my family, I decided to do 2 cups of brown rice, and the water the booklet called for (0.4 L, I think the instructions said). Because the book didn't do a great job of explaining whether you put the water in up to the level on the bowl first, I went and looked at the Zojirushi website where it said to put the water in, then the rinsed rice. So I did just that. Everything looked good and I turned the machine on. After about 10 minutes, so much water and steam started coming out of the machine, I had to put a paper towel on top so that my counter wouldn't get all covered in water. When that got soaked after a couple of minutes, I did another. When that got soaked, I had to pull out a shamwow style of towel and a sponge to catch any overflow. (Picture shown after I pulled the towel off so you can see the steam/water coming out). After about 10 minutes of that, the water boiling subsided to just enough that the towel and sponge were no longer needed.Hoping the rice is worth the trouble! In the future, if you eat more than a few servings of rice in your family, you might want to get a slightly larger rice cooker. Since it's just me, my husband, and my son, we really don't need the full two dry cups (to whatever cooked amount that creates...6 cups?), so I think we'll be fine just doing the one dry cup. Hopefully this helps someone!"

But it quickly becomes your best friend.There are a lot of settings, but that's because it can do so much more than rice, and make it just right for you. So easy to clean, it almost cleans itself. It apparently simply does not make burnt or crispy rice where it touches the pot, you truly can't screw it up. If anything, the extended warm feature makes the rice even nicer over the time it takes you to finish cooking the rest of the meal, when you're distracted or running behind. It has delayed cook features, on case you need it to start cooking at a set time, and apparently even learns your preferences over time.This is expensive, but if you eat rice even semi-regularly, and fine cooking it on the stovetop to be a pain for whatever reason, it's worth every penny."

I especially like making basmati with chicken broth; that's our staple. The machine will keep the rice fresh and hot for as long as 24 hours, adjust to different quantities automatically, and do everything but water your plants.  It's also very easy to clean, though you have to careully wipe the vent hole in the lid if you used liquids other than plain water, like broth or something with oil. We've used it every day since we got it. Worth every penny.2010 UPDATE:We've now had this cooker for 4 years. It's just as good today as the day we bought it. The main thing is to keep it clean, a very easy task except for cleaning out the small vent hole in the lid. If you cook dishes with many ingredients besides rice (spices or finely chopped vegetables, for example), some residue can get lodged in there. You can easily clean it with a moistened q-tip, though. All in all, we're still very happy with this purchase."
