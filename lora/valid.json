It did ok with spinach (still specks of green but the texture was fine). They say it doesn’t work with frozen things, but I added frozen banana and mango (small chunks) and it worked fine. So for simple smoothies, it’s probably good (no celery, no mature greens, but that’s not a big deal to me, and I definitely wouldn’t use ice.). The capacity is a bit too small—you can only get one large smoothie out of it, or two 6 to 7 oz ones.

Virtually the only thing I use the blender for is pesto. The Magic Bullet was an epic fail at that. There was no way to get it to process the basil leaves, likely because pesto doesn’t take a lot of liquid.<br><br>The 600 watt Nutribullet, which I found had some other issues, blended the pesto well (as with a blender, it ended up a bit over processed but tasty).

He sits on the counter and drops the produce in and uses the plunger to mash it down the chute.  I'm so excited to be able to make him fresh, healthy juice.

    "output": "I don't feel like washing an extra item so I skip the steam ...: As many other reviewers will tell you, this rice cooker has boil-over issues if you don't have the steam tray in place. I'm a lazy cook; I don't feel like washing an extra item so I skip the steam tray. Instead, before I set the lid on I give a quick spray on the inside walls of the cooking vessel with non-stick spray. This achieves the same effect by preventing foam from being able to climb up the sides of the pot. Plus, if you use olive oil spray it adds a little flavor.Major con:The lid is not well-built. It's annoying to clean inside the rim and you have to disassemble the knob to properly clean under it. The black part of the knob where the screw locks in is cheap plastic and it cracked after 6 months. Now, I can't get a tight lock. Sometimes, holding the handle by the knob is enough for the weight of the lid to pull the screw right out. This, of course, is a real pain when you have a hot lid. You can order a replacement lid assembly for about $15 from Cuisinart's parts department, but it feels like a ripoff. If it had a better lid, 4 stars.If you can get past that, it makes great rice every time. I even like to sweat diced onions and peppers in the pot before adding the rice and liquid."

You have to make sure you read the instructions because if you don't alternate the soft and the harder fruit and veggies, the soft will get clogged in the grinder.  You need that harder material to go through to push out the soft pulps.  I'm a beginner juicer and was borrowing my sister's juicer which was a GE.  The Omega is much sturdier and does not jump around like the GE and so much quieter than the GE which sounds like jet engines.  I like the feeder shoot on the Omega, nothing comes flying out of it like the GE.  The clean up is easier with the Omega and it is easy to put together and take apart.  And, I love the fold down handle on the top, so much easier to move around.  Also, there are so many different tips for different functions that I have not even begun to figure out but it looks like it can be used as a shreader/dicer/chopper as well.  Happy Juicing!!!"

Everywhere the carrot touched is now stained orange. I soaked it in Dawn and even put it in the dishwasher...it still came out orange. My 40-year-old Salad Shooter doesn't have any stains on it. What is the problem!? So every food it contacts is going to absorb food juices? How is that healthy and/or safe. I am very disappointed in a product that has been my right hand for decades and still works great. Apparently the new one is being made from different materials. I'm not using an appliance that absorbs and holds food matter that easily."

The crust does get crispy which I was worried about and the top is also cooked perfectly. I think it actually does better than the oven and the temp seems more controlled with this device so it cooks super evenly. And it came with time suggestions in the manual that were very accurate which was great. This is actually a super versatile small appliance that you can cook a surprising variety of foods on. Over all super happy with it and it was like 25$ cheaper on here than the other cheapest place I could find it!!!!"

The stainless steel juice collector does not stain and is dishwasher safe (unlike the plastic collectors).  The juicing blade is supposed to be titanium reinforced.  While I can't tell looking at it, the titanium should keep the blades sharp much, much longer.  I looks well built. Looks good on your counter (because it is big) and goes through anything we've put in in like butter.  Only downside, is it's pricey, but as they say, you get what you pay for."

The only flaw is that the plastic container is not a hard plastic. It feels like it could snap. I've used it 3 times and I feel like the handle could break off. Be careful when cleaning and handling. If you dropped it at all I feel like it would completely break. Other than that works very well."

Not anxious to find out if I’m wrong. Although they never held onto to the cup when you got one at the diner.But it works like it should and looks nice on the countertop, like you mean business.Update 12/2020: having used this almost daily to satisfy my malted milkshake addiction, I’ve found the motor rattles terribly when mixing milkshakes. I thought it was defective, but more likely the thickness of the mixture sticking to the plastic agitator. I’m at the end of my return window, and don’t think replacing it might solve the problem. They make one that looks similar, and appears to have a metal tip (model 65120), but is more than twice the price. They also make a commercial grade model (HMD200), but that one is well in excess of $300.Will see how long this one lasts, and then consider the alternatives. I’ve lowered my rating to 3 stars for suspicions it may not last long. If I was confident it had a long life, it would be a 5 star product. For both it’s classic look, and extraordinary results."

Neither of them helped fix the issue and all I see on the screen is the timer running continuously and nothing else.At this price, I expected that this rice cooker will last a long time and definitely did not expect it to stop working in a year. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed with the durability and longevity of the product.I'm now working with Zojirushi Customer Service to fix the issue. They've been helpful so far.

I had been using a hand press that did a very good job but is messy and labor intensive. The Breville Elite is well made and easy to clean, but I have to put the seed pulp through a second time to get the maximum amount of juice from the seeds. The juice is cloudy and foamy and I will have to filter it to get a bright, clear juice. All-in-all, however, it is fast and even the second processing makes the job much faster and easier than the hand press.I realize that juicing pomegranate seeds is not the usual function of this machine and that it can not be adequately judged on this basis. I cannot say whether there is a machine out there that would do a better job with this fruit. I will be trying some juice recipes to take full advantage of my purchase.The unit is sturdy and clean-up is fast and easy. It does have a rather large footprint and is heavy, so storage is something to be considered."

That one's electronics finally gave out, but I wanted another Emerson.I did not want one with all the complicated air fryer, convection, I'll-even-do-the-dishes features.  The more complicated a thing is, the easier it is to break.  So far, I am happy with my choice.The only down side is that the printing on the control panel membrane is difficult to see.  At least it is for my 67 year old eyes.This one puts out half as many watts of power as the bigger Emerson it replaced, but by adjusting my cooking times it works just as well.It is a small microwave, so don't think you'll cook a turkey in here.  but the interior design is such that it maximizes the amount of room for things to spin as they cook.The instant cook buttons are handy.  Want to warm something for 2 minutes, just press the 2, without pressing anything else first, and the oven will run at full power for 2 minutes.  The 1 through 6 buttons are set up this way.  Or you can program it to cook for a specific time, like 1½ minutes at full power or at a lower power by using the Power button.The manual is pretty clear in its instruction, so it took me only a few minutes to learn the functions I use all the time.I doubt this one will also last me 20 years, but I'm hoping Emerson Electric has provided another sturdy appliance."

I love having the option of grilling but also using it as a slow cooker and skillet etc...So far I've tried chicken, hambergers, veggies, turkey sausage and they have all turned out really good.  I can fit about two chicken breasts in there or 3 small - medium sized burgers, to give you an idea of the size.  Just be aware that you need to really monitor the temp as it gets really hot really fast and it can burn things if you aren't watching it. Start with a little lower temp and then gradually move up if needed.  On the flip side, i love how quickly it heats up and how it cooks things thru when you put the lid on it.  The chicken flavor reminded me of how it would be on a gas grill outdoors.  Also, I love how easy this is to clean.  Other grills I've had in the past were awful and this one all comes apart and fits right in my sink and because of the non-stick coating, it really makes cleaning a breeze. (I have not tried it in the dishwasher and would not recommend doing that other than the glass lid) The white plastic holder does seem a little cheap but it's holding up ok so far.  Truthfully, this is the best indoor grill I've ever had.  While I can't speak to the longevity of it, I can speak to the fact that at this point in time it works and works very well.  Would highly recommend."

Adding a little less means you do not have an entire waffle.  I have to put a magazine or waxed paper under the waffle maker in order to catch the mess.Final thoughts:  You get what you pay for.

    "output": "Best Rice Ever.: Okay, I lived in Japan for 10+ years, and have been visiting there for over 30 years, so I have eaten a lot of rice in my time. In all honesty, I'm not even that crazy about rice. Being a former baker, I much prefer bread, and over all this time have always thought that rice is rice, you know what I mean?Since I moved back to the U.S. about five years ago, I used a cheap rice cooker/steamer/yogurt maker from Costco. It did the job, and cooked rice fairly adequately. It died on me last year, though, and my wife BEGGED me to buy a quality rice cooker to replace it. Though a cheapskate at heart, I'm also a big softie, so after spending hours online researching rice cookers in English and Japanese, we settled on the 5.5 cup model of this one. It lacks all the bells and whistles of higher end suihanki, but it has high reviews, the most modern technology and design features to cook rice well, and Zojirushi is one of the most trusted brands in Japan.As much as I have wanted to believe that my wife was over finicky about rice (typical male?), I am not too proud to admit when I am wrong. I was so wrong - the rice that this appliance cooks is truly phenomenal! Whereas the rice in the previous cooker had soft and hard spots - some rice overcooked and some undercooked - the rice from this one is uniformly consistent. Each grain comes out glossy and chewy, with just the right amount of stickiness.If you want to make any popular Japanese dishes, from the lowly onigiri (rice balls), to sushi - everything turns out more delicious with rice from this cooker. I truly don't understand how there can be such an immediate, explicit difference in the quality of the cooked rice. We use the same exact brand of rice every time, and my wife doesn't even use any of the \"fancy\" features on the device - she just hits \"quick rice.\"Nearly two hundred dollars may seem like an exorbitant amount to spend on a one-trick pony appliance like this (especially considering our bread machine was only around 50 bucks). Rest assured, though, this is money well spent. I cannot recommend this rice cooker enough."

Signs of death are always the same: the switch/light turn to \"warm\" before the water has even been heated up. Due to travel, I didn't even get to use the last rice cooker for two months, and then it died after 3 batches of rice, so too much time lapsed and I couldn't submit a return request. While it's a beaut of a rice cooker, I would advise against purchasing one!"

You can put the rice and water in the machine and set it to be ready when the party starts...wonderful! Every time the rice has come out perfect and no burnt or stuck rice to the bottom of the cooker.  The price is high but worth it if you eat a lot of rice."

It makes great waffles when the plates stay in place. The upper plate does not like staying in place. I have tried slightly bending the single clip that is supposed to hold it, and it will, for perhaps 2 waffles. Then it’s back to falling off when you are trying to remove the waffle from the bottom half. IMO, this product would greatly benefit by having 2 clips for the top part.The waffles come out well, and I like being able to choose how well done/crispy I want the outside to be."

I attest: all the positive, raving ones are true.It is hard to mess up rice in this puppy. I've tried different settings, types of rice, mixed in veggies (frozen and fresh) and have loved ALL results.Is the music irritating? Not this happy camper. It lets everyone know dinner is ready (I normally make my rice last) and the smell of the rice more than makes up for the loud chime.There are 2 measuring cups and a spatula. These extra accessories are a plus and all fit inside the pan (inside the cooker) for storage.The pan is SUPER easy to clean. Even when I did one rice pot with no oil. It didnt stick to the pot. It's the only pot my kid (15 yr old) volunteers to wash. Oh, and I think its dishwasher safe.Could you work with one a little cheaper? Maybe, but I'm glad I didnt try and fail.

The grinding is nice and the mechanism is better than a cheaper unit that I purchased Target in which the tab that controls the switch broke off because the mechanism was so poorly designed. This is more robust and easier to use. Also it only takes 5 minutes to clean. I was skeptical that the wattage may not be enough but the machine is designed well enough so that the power does not seem to be a problem. Still I would follow the directions and wouldn't use it for any large or hard materials."

Oh sure, it might boil over sometimes and make a big mess and the rice might be soft one night and a little hard the next but rice is rice I thought.  But, I do love rice and someone suggested I might enjoy a rice cooker so I came to Amazon to do some research.  After reading dozens of customer reviews and agonizing about what size, whether no logic, fuzzy logic or neuro fuzzy logic would be best, and worry about which brand would be the most dependable, I finally decided on the \"Zo\" Zac-10 and after having it only a few days, I'm certain I made the right decision.  I found it very simple to operate although I agree the instruction booklet leaves a lot to be desired.  Plain old long grain white rice is tasty, light, fluffy and so much better than the rice I once prepared in a pan on the stove. I can't wait to try jambalaya, pilaf, risotto and puddings.  Do order the Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook.  It has some great recipes that will enhance your appreciation of the rice cooker and it's capabilities."

No need for setting timers or watching your food closely.... simply press the button down and check back when convenient for you, when your rice completes it will be stored at ready to eat temp.Tips for using and cooking quick rice/veggies:Open lid and spray down with cooking sprayadd rice/water/butterinsert additional steaming colanderadd canned veggies/fresh veggies/seafood etc of choiceadd the lid to the toppress the buttonwait until unit switches from cook to warm.I only took off one star because the design of the colander could have been a bit better.. they could have added a handle or something to make it easier to dismount keep hot pads handy because obviously when it's been steaming for a few minutes it will be hot."

I poured way less of the batter into the iron. This time, I increased the heat to 4. I checked and the top was still white. I turned it to 5. Still white. I decided to look at the bottom,  it was brown. So...uneven heating elements on top an bottom.  The rest of the batch, I just flipped halfway thru.

While you are making your waffles, they come loose. Your waffles not only do not cook properly, but you also can't get the waffles grates back on the machine while they're hot. We tried to manually bend the clips to secure the grates, but that doesn't work either – this waffle maker simply ejects the grates. It's awful. We had a beautiful old-fashioned waffle maker that we received as a wedding gift that we enjoyed for decades, but it is no longer made. I just threw out this disgusting Black & Decker wafflemaker because I tried 1 last time to make it work today and the grate fell out on my hand!! Now I have a painful burn. I am furious.

If we wanted that, we'd still be making rice on the stove top in a pan. We have a Zojirushi now.Ok, the Zojirushi, isn't a steamer, so the Cuisinart has become an egg and vegetable steamer.  Six refrigerated eggs in the steamer for 23 minutes and they are perfectly hard boiled.  For vegetables, just follow the times in the instruction booklet - they turn out very nice. No overflowing either, nice.2 stars since it is a very messy rice cooker.<update>Others comment that if I'd read other reviews and tips, then I'd not have the overflow problem. I shouldn't have to and someone considering a purchase should know this is a wildly seen problem. The device should be calibrated correctly, especially since it is a \"rice cooker\".We are still using it as a steamer. It works perfectly. It hasn't seen rice in 4+ years."

I like the forward and reverse switch mechanism for clearing jams.  Reverse automatically stops when you remove pressure.  Since I didn't have to actually use it, I can't tell you that it works great. All peices ahave a good fit. The stainless makes cleaning rather easy.

Most available modern day items are round, deep, shaped like Mickey Mouse (nothing at all wrong with that!) but they just don't seem to have the surface area.  So, if you are trying to make waffles for four (or more) those types just can't keep up.  This one works great.... teflon surface essentially eliminates stuck waffles, turns out good size waffles, cleans up in a flash.  Grids turn over to offer a flat surface, upper part of iron will go horizontal so you could use both flat surfaces available for eggs, etc.  Cord is a little short (extension cord is not recommended) but I just use a TV tray next to the breakfast table and all works out fine.  It's a nice waffle iron."

I usually rinse my rice 3 to 6 times, but with certain types of rice that wasn't enough to keep it from making a mess. With white rice it shouldn't be an issue though.It's also not very big, but it probably makes enough for 2 to 4 people.

I had one for years, but eventually the lid broke and I couldn't pop corn without kernels popping right out of the top, so it was time to buy a new one.  The greatest advantage of  the popper is that you can pop with or without butter/oil. I find the popcorn from air poppers to be pretty dry. With this, I literally just add 4 drops of oil onto the unpopped kernels, swirl it around, and I love the result! But you don't have to add any, I'm pretty sure you could also add half a stick of butter and get good results as well.  For me the only downside is the need to keep buying the PowerCup concentrators. You can, however, make perfectly good popcorn without the concertrators, but you will end up with more unpopped kernels."

I needed to finish the waffles, because I promised the kids (5 to 15) waffles!

This \"Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker and Warmer\" simply transforms rice and elevates it to a higher plane of existence.  There's no way to compare rice cooked in a pot to what comes out of this rice maker.  We like rice.  We've been making it and eating it fairly regularly for years.  The same rice we used in a pot is entirely different (and delicious) when we cook it in this.  After seeing how good our normal rice was in this thing, we tried a batch of brown rice (I've hated brown rice since the dawn of time).  Even brown rice cooked in this rice maker comes out excellent.  Amazing.The downside, of course, is the price.  You just stare at it and go back and forth over whether or not plain-ol-rice is worth that amount of money.  Well, it is.  I rate this Zojirushi rice cooker at a Excellent 5 stars out of 5."

Where it shines, though, is with cooking short-grain white rice  – the type most commonly found in Japanese and Korean cuisine.

    "output": "Oh Ya!: I love this thing!  I was using a smaller less powerful juicer and decided that I needed something faster and that would reduce prep time.  I was spending a lot of time cutting my fruit and veggies just so I could get it into my old juicer.  To be fair, my other juicer worked fine and did what it was suppose to, it just wasn't efficient for my needs.I love Breville products and I had great expectations for this juicer.  I did my research and I knew what I features I was looking for.  I wanted something that had a powerful motor to grind through harder fruit and produce with out bogging the motor and I wanted a juicer that had a feed channel that would minimize my prep time.  I came across a few models and brands that seemed to fit the criteria, but my love for Breville products (based on experience and not marketing) made my decision simple.After learning more about the juicers that fit my criteria I really felt that buying a juicer that was all metal was in my best interest.  Aesthetically it fit my preference and taste and fit in with my current line-up of small kitchen appliances.  Materially, the stainless steel seemed a more durable option than the resin plastics of other brands.  Additionally, stainless steel in my opinion, is easier to sterilize and holds up well in the dishwasher and I don't have to worry about fading or cracking.Now on to the juicing.  I opened the box and to my expectation the juicer was packed well.  I came out of the box ready to use.  I cleaned the parts that would touch my juice as recommended.  I turned on the motor and was surprised at how quiet it was.  My smaller juicer sounded like a chainsaw in comparison, not to mention the motor on my smaller juicer was only 125w compared to the 1000w of the 800JEXL.  I expected that it would be louder just because of the motor size difference but again it was surprisingly quite.I juiced apples, carrots, celery, oranges, pears, beets, cucumber, kale, spinach and ginger to make my normal juice.  It took literally 5 minutes whereas my older juicer took about a half hour.  Prep of produce and fruit was easy as I did not need to cut anything.  It all fit right into the large feed tunnel - one of the key reasons I bought this juicer.  I noticed that I got more juice out of this juicer than my previous one.  I know now that is because of the motor and juicing mesh.  Because of the motor size combined with the mesh, the combination extracts more juice from the produce and fruit.  This ultimately saves me money in the long run although I am not able to quantify that at this point considering I have only been using it for a couple of weeks now.All-in-all, I HIGHLY recommend this juicer!  Breville is a GREAT brand and I am pleased with their quality and performance.  The description of the machine in the manufacturers marketing is as promised and it is understated in my opinion.  I appreciate quality and although this model may seem a bit high in price for some, I can only say you get what you pay for!"

Now I can cut it into pieces and shred the soap for confetti soap - mixing the shreds into another batch of cold process soap and mold it. The salad shooter makes quick work of it. One tip I will give though is don't let the shavings collect inside the cone. I was shaving into a storage bag and I kept getting clumps. Likely because all the shreds weren't falling out if the cone and they were sticking together. Disassembly is easy as I remember - take off the ring, pull out the blade and twist off the feed chute."

Its more for controling amount of kernal going into unit.  The discharge could be a little better designed.  You will need a really large, wide bowl to catch the popcorn.  The corn will fly all over near the end of cycle.  Also!!  The kernals are so hot and some will end up in your bowl heated and reafy to blow.  And will pop inside your bowl sending other corn to spray on to the floor and other places.  Just be ready with a broom.  Its ok because they arent greasy so easy clean up.I still like it.

    "output": "Good juicer, with some idiocyncracies . . .: I was encouraged to begin juicing after watching a video \"Fat, Sick, and Almost Dead,\" by Joe Cross.  I did my research and elected to replace my 10-year old Omega spinner, which was a pain to clean and inexplicably just stopped working as I began my juicing regime.  I looked a the arguments for centrifugal, like my old Omega, versus masticating juicers, like the venerable Champion.  In the end, I chose this Breville.Upon opening and assembly, it is truly an impressive beast.  It is large and stands tall on the counter, with a large vertrical feed tube, through which you insert the fruit and vegetables onto a spinning \"Nutridisk,\" which is a combination grinder plate and screen/filter that rises off the disk at about 45 degrees, throwing the detritus as processed over to a good sized waste bucket.  Therein lies the first of its idiocyncracies.While processing the veggies and fruit, you have to be quick to insert the pusher, or bits of ground up stuff fly back at you and over the kitchen.  My wife, who is a cleaning fanatic, found this unacceptable.  But, with practice, and a quick two-handed feeding operation mastered, the problem is minimized.The second idiocyncracy is a problem that reading manual before use would have solved.  Without having done that, I am a guy after all, I started processing merrily and producing juice, but the arrangement of waste container which sets under, but not attached to the feeder cover, allows for waste bits to fly from between the bucket and the cover.  Another wifely correction forced reading of the manual, which recommends that you insert one of the bags you bring the veggies home with into the bucket, to make cleaning of the bucket easier.  Well, duh, taking the bucket to the composter and then bringing the bucket back to be washed every time was a bit of a pain; and, giving your clean-freak wife an easy victory on two fronts, humbling her man and avoiding cleaning another kitchen utensil were big pluses.The last set of idiocyncracies have to do with design.  Dip a toe into the juicing world and you confront kale, which I had always thought belonged in soup and was otherwise passed without notice in the veggie department. I like it in soup, but was unprepared for the pleasant earthy goodness it added to juices.  Along with its similar but unrelated buddy, broccoli raab or rapini, they have quickly become my most consumed green stuff.  But, this design grinds the stems and produces juice, with the leaves simply chopped into bits into the hopper. I am thinking of reserving the stems for juicing and the leaves for soup.  But, that is a story of another sort, for then I will have to compete with the aforementioned bride who just doesn't like to keep anything around long enough to show any signs of wilting.Another design difficulty has to do with economy of construction and user cleaning.  The housing over the Nutridisk is somehow spun or machined, leaving fine grooves on the inside.  While the machine is easy to clean on first blush, and is represented to be dishwasher safe, these grooves provide some difficulty.  When processing highly colored veggies, that color stays in those grooves, unless you are scrupulous about scrubbing them out.  Worse, if you just rinse the thing, which is a temptation if you are going to juice more than once a day, these grooves beging to show a distinct greenish color if not cleaned thoroughly.  Even the dishwasher fails to get this stuff out; it requires some elbow grease.A further design problem is the spout, which the advertising suggests a glass is enough to collect the juice.  There is a well built plastic pitcher which fits and collects the juice, but I advise you to immediately place a cup of some sort to collect the drips.  I use a quarter cup measure with a narrow base and wider top, which overlaps the wide base of the juicer engine unit.  A straight sided glass will not be wide enough to catch those last little drops.The design is a compromise, I understand.  Even with two speeds, one for soft stuff, like grapes and mango, and one faster one for harder stuff, like carrots, apples, and celery, there is a lot of waste.  Perhaps I will reinvest some time in the manual to see if I can reduce the loss. But, as one of the pluses, my second compost bin has filled very quickly.Other pluses are the introduction to other formerly ignored foodstuffs like ginger, because I didn't know what the hell to do with it unless it was Chinese stir fry; pears, because they went from hard as a rock to rotten in a nanosecond; beets, which I love roasted, but never were a big fave otherwise.Last, the Breville is not really good with soft stuff, like bananas, or citrus. One must have other devices which are better at juicing those things.  But, as a follower of Alton Brown, I had hoped for a fully multi-tasking device, but hope springs eternal and sometimes leads to disappointment.[ADDED COMMENT: 2/28/14] A WARNING: Do NOT put the juice jug in the dishwasher, especially the bottom basket where the heat is greater.  In a surprise, following the advice that all the parts were machine washable, I rinsed and placed the jug in the dishwasher several times.  The jug appears to be of durable and thick plastic; but, to my disappointment, the heat of the dishwasher warped the top lip and cover of the jug.Amazon does not have replacements; you must contact Breville directly.  At $16.00 a pop, they are not overly expensive; but, I would have liked to have avoided the warping/melting with a product warning.David O'Connell"

    "output": "Simple design lacks any common sense safety mechanism: This simple air popper design is reminiscent of the air popper I used while growing up. I didn’t think to look for any specific options when purchasing it, but it lacks some common sense safety features. There is no on/off switch nor timer. It is turned on by plugging it into the wall, and turned off by unplugging it from the wall. In a short time, it has enough heat output to all but destroy itself.It is marketed as leaving “virtually no un-popped kernels”, so it is tempting to leave it running to try to get those last few kernels to pop. DON’T DO IT! On the first use, with Orville Redenbacher original popcorn kernels, I expected unpopped kernel count to be low. There were still several kernels bouncing around, so I let it run a little longer before unplugging it. Not many remaining kernels did pop, but the extra duration was sufficient to slightly deform the clear plastic top and melt the bottom of the plastic butter tray enough to cause it to stick to the rest of the lid. The air popper (from another manufacturer) I used as a child had a metal butter tray and is still functioning. I don’t expect the same longevity out of this unit and I would exercise extreme caution using this around children. This gets HOT and you certainly wouldn’t want kids fumbling around on a counter trying to unplug it from the wall. Otherwise, it is relatively inexpensive and functional albeit simple. If I had to purchase another, I would look for alternatives."

    "output": "Excellent appliance that lives up to the hype: I spent months shopping for this rice cooker, going back and forth between cheaper and more expensive rice cookers. Having once lived in Japan over 4 years, it isn't \"just a rice cooker\" as my wife purports, so I decided on a Zoji in the end. My only initial hesistation was the inbility to replace the battery in the LCD display.  However, the ability to cook brown rice just as well as other rice and its record for reliability outweighed the battery issue. I've had the NS-ZCC10 for two months, using it 2-3 times a week, and have been very pleased with the results. And the concern that it would not make enough for a family of five has been no issue as I seldom have the need to make more than 3 cups for a single meal. (In Japan its typical to have a batch of rice cooked up to eat throughout the day, however, I only use it for single meals) Cleanup is super simple compared to the aluminum single button Hitachi I had for 20 years (it was broken by the movers- maybe it should have broken sooner)."

The plates slide around and the mechanism to hold the plates in place is just a simple metal tab that scratches the plates. The temperature knob rattles around and spins way too easily. All the plastic feels cheap, thin, and doesn't feel like it'll last more than a few cycles.It's just a cheaply made product that is living off it's name and not on quality that it was known for.

Tallow solidifies at room temperature, so I needed a deep fryer that didn’t have a submersible heating element. I believe others have said that the oil temp can get too hot, but personally I don’t think I’ve seen it go over 375 degrees. That’s the exact temperature I wanted to cook wings in anyways, so it works well for us! Maybe if you let it preheat too long the temperature will go up higher? Not sure on that though."

The \"grill\" is built in so you have that grilled look when cooking meat or veggies. Also, it heats up REALLY fast.

It has a warm setting that allows you to cook something and turn the thermostat down to warm until you are ready to eat.

Russian teacakes turn out wonderfully with finely chopped nuts and so do other cookies and coarse chopping is possible too (for fruitcake ? and biscotti). The processor has 2 settings, chop and grind. I highly recommend this appliance for making chopped onion for tuna salad and you will find other uses for this appliance. The bowl, blade assembly and lid are easy to clean with dish soap and hot water (just be careful when washing the blade, it is very sharp). I am sure this mini processor will become one of your favorite appliances."

Right out of the box, the coating was coming off edges of the waffle plates.  Prepped it for use anyway (thinking I could overlook that minor part), turned the unit on and closed it to heat.  The bottom waffle plate immedately popped out of the security tab in the front.  Turned off the unit, unplugged it, and once it cooled, I rotated the plates thinking that might help.  But this time, the bottom plate popped out of the tab and then the top plate popped out.  When the top plate pops out, it falls.  Dangerous if it had been hot!  Upon VERY close inspection, it seems that the drip spout of the waffle pieces are off or missized just enough to keep them from \"fitting\" together when in use and therefore, causing one or both plates to pop out of the front tab.  I did not reverse them to see if the same thing happened with the griddle sides.Not only useless if the plates don't stay in place, but dangerous if the unit is hot when they pop out.  AND messy if the plate happens to have batter on it when it pops out."

After only a handful of uses, hand washing in between, there's literally no nonstick surface. I have to excessively spray with cooking spray to get it to release. It cooks so unevenly, that I have to flip the actual waffle on the cooker to make sure both sides are evenly cooked. The worst part is it takes nearly 10 minutes to cook one freaking waffle.

    "output": "Love It: After many years of making horrible rice on the stovetop, hit or miss EVERY TIME and mostly miss, not to mention the spill over the second I blink, I recently discovered how to make decent rice in a pressure cooker (Wolfgang Puck 5 Quart). The rice came out great but the pressure cooker was too bulky, cumbersome, too many parts and pieces to clean, and took up a lot of counter space. I wanted something smaller that I can leave on the countertop and still make good rice. I also have one of the cheaper rice cookers/steamer with the glass lid and a simple \"on\" button. Maybe I used it incorrectly but I didn't like the texture or flavor of the rice it made. It also took too much guess work on how much water I needed to use per cup of rice. I hate guesswork after a long day and being hungry so that rice cooker sat in my cupboard for about 3 years. Anyway, onto the Zojirushi rice cooker. After MUCH reading I decided this would be perfect for me since just about everyone says it makes perfect rice every time. Yes, it is pricey but I prefer to invest in great products that get good use rather than waste money on something that will sit in my cupboard collecting dust. But that's just me. I received the rice cooker on the estimated delivery date, and I used it the very second it arrived. It doesn't take up much more counter space than maybe a four slice toaster. It comes with a spatula, spatula holder which clips on either the right or left side of the rice cooker, the inner bowl with easy to see/read water markers/measurements, two rice measuring cups (one for white rice, and one for brown rice), and an instruction booklet that includes a few recipes. It has a handle which makes for easy transfer from countertop to dinner table or anywhere you want it, and it even has a retractable cord which I thought was fantastic (one less thing to lose or figure out what it belongs to). The cover pops up and closes rather smoothly. The buttons are nice and easy to read, and pretty straightforward. As for ease of use, it is wonderful at least for making simple white rice since that was all I used it for straight out of the box WITHOUT reading instructions and I saw it demonstrated on Youtube a bazillion times. I rinsed three cups of jazmin rice, put it in the inner bowl, poured water in up to the three cup line for white rice (note: water measurements are different for brown rice), gave it a swirl so the rice was even, pressed the menu button to white rice/harder setting, then the cooking/reheat button. It played a tune to let me know it started and I walked away. That was it. I left it unattended while I did other things and didn’t notice when it was done which, for me, was a good thing since I wanted to know how it kept the rice in such a case since I’m always multi-tasking. It automatically switches to keep warm mode. I’d say I left it for about 40-45 mins so I’m not quite sure how long it took exactly for the rice to complete cooking BUT the good thing was the rice did not have any burn marks at the bottom. It was fluffy and moist but not wet. It was perfect rice.  I even smelled the difference in the rice, and it tasted great. The texture, consistency, and stickiness were just right for my liking. My hubby gets home from work hours after I do so I kept it in the keep warm mode for only 2 hrs fearing it would dry out but when he got home 3 hrs later the rice was just as good as when it was just done. A bit more wetness from the steam trapped inside but it didn’t affect the rice in any way after a quick stir. Also, the bowl sits snug in the cooker so when you stir it doesn’t swirl around all pointless. Well, I only got the cooker yesterday and I was only able to use it once for one type of rice so I hope this helps for those of you who are more concerned about plain white rice like I was. I still have leftover rice in the cooker so I cannot comment on the ease of clean up but there are only two things to clean, the non-stick bowl (should be a breeze), and the inner lid gasket which looks like it can be wiped/rinsed clean. The spatula can be tossed in the dishwasher/hand washed. The main part itself can be wiped down with a damp cloth but it made absolutely zero mess/spills when I used it so I don’t even need to do that. As I use the other functions I will update. My one and only concern and reason for 3 stars is the battery. I’ve read that it should last approx. 4-5 yrs and can only be replaced by the company. I do not have the time or money to spend on something that should be so simple. That, to me, is the only flaw in the making of this product. Being the DIY person that I am, if the battery does fail I will be opening it myself to fix it. Also, the clock stays on even when unplugged which uses up battery life. Some people may like that feature but it wastes battery life making for quicker replacement."

We liked the fact that the Breville's chute is large enough to minimize or even eliminate cutting the fruit and that the pulp is ejected which would also save time when juicing large quantities.  While its design reduces the need to cut up the fruit, I have to say that the quality and quantity of juice is very inferior compared to my the old Acme, and it was not at all time-saving because of the extra time to clean and the waste involved.  We had to allow the juice to sit overnight in the refrigerator in order to settle and then siphoned it for a clearer product due to the very large amount of foam generated (2\" of juice with the remainder foam in the pitcher), and the juice contained pulp too, not clear at all, despite cleaning the basket after every pitcher.  The extricated pulp was moist and contained CHUNKS of fruit in it.  The third session before any fruit was introduced to it, the motor noticeably sped up and slowed down.  We packed it up and returned it.  We would not recommend this juicer."

I put a cutting board underneath and place it well in the centre of the counter when I use it so that it won't spray the hot, starchy water onto the floor, cupboards... or most importantly, that it won't spray hot water on me! With the liquid overflow during each use, it also takes quite a bit of clean-up afterwards. This is the only rice cooker I have ever owned, so I don't know if they all have this same messy flaw in design, or if it only this particular model.

Brings me back to my childhood dinners with my family and can't wait to share with my child. We did a traditional fondue and cooked steak, tuna, turkey, pork & a ton of veggies in vege oil last night and had a blast. We had a ton of different sauces to dip in and ate for hours. This fondue pot get hot enough and works perfect. Very sleek and pretty too. And big enough pot for everyone to be cooking at once. Mushrooms in oil rock. Your don't even need a dipping sauce. Haven't tried a cheese of chocolate fondue in this pot yet but that is not how I was brought up eating it so I doubt I will do much of that anyway. The oil is great!! I don't understand the whole cheese fondue cuz it just seems like you areUsing the pot for a dipping sauce instead of what it is intended for- cooking your dinner at the table. The manual comes with a ton of different fondue recipes so you can get creative. Highly recommended."

Most of the time it overheats half-way through the cycle and stops.

I have never been able to get two batches out of it, and rarely one. I fill the cup exactly to the top and follow the instructions exactly. There's nothing you can mess up. The machine is poorly desgned, in my opinion, and the heater inside gets way too hot and trips the built-in emergency shutoff thermostat.

I cooked wild rice and it are over an hour. Even jasmine rice takes about 40 min. The pre-determined measuring lines for rice (white or brown) is only if you are using short or medium grain. I typically use long grain. The default porridge amounts is not what you used if you are cooking oats. On their website, they do have instructions on how to cook all of these other options, but it is not easy to find. Maybe in Japan where this rice cooker is made most people use short or medium grain rice, but this is not the case where I live. It would be nice to have long grain white and brown rice as an automatic setting instead of having to find what is the proper water to rice ratio and setting for this particular rice cooker which is buried somewhere in their website. The results are perfect, but figuring out how to get there and the time it takes to get there can be annoying."

    "output": "OK, I have not tried rice yet, but...: For the price, and for the ease of cleanup alone, this steamer is fabulous. I have used the \"fan\" inserts for pots over the last 200 years (so it seems), and bought this steamer as part of my ongoing effort to build the ultimate kitchen in the small space that I now have availabe. I figured that a plug in appliance like this would free up a burner for a real pot.Wow! So far, I have used it for broccolli, asparagus, carrots, green beans, eggs, and fish. It is so far ahead of the pot inserts in terms of speed and quality of the finished product, that the two do not even remotely compare. One reviewer had a problem with brown rice. I have not tried to cook brown rice with it yet, but I know that rice needs a lot of water. This may not be the best machine for brown rice. A dedicated rice cooker might be the answer here. On the other hand, if you want PERFECTLY steamed veggies of any variety, even two or three at a time, and want them done to order with a bell to indicate that it's time to serve them, buy this gem of a machine.Cleanup is a dishwasher snap, and for those who worry about draining vitamin content from their cooked greens, a full stack of produce yields only a few ounces of condensate in the pop out drip tray. There may be better out there, but until I see it in action, this gem has my vote."

I ordered one and will have too see whether its still working.The specifications for this product are written underneath the product and stated below:120VAC60HZ1AmpsPlease get something which can convert voltage to the above parameters for smooth functioning.Initially when I tried putting a potato(when the green sparks started) ... It sliced it very well. And it's easy to clean too. So no problem with functioning.For normal Aramex delivery it took 20 days to reach India. If you didn't opt for Amazon packaging... It would come with just the presto box with addresses stamped on top of the box.Will update after I try with the step down transformer."

All parts were hand washed and the included brush was used to clean the mesh as the instructions stated to do.  However each time it was used the pulp which was getting wetter and wetter.  It was blowing probably a half a cup of juice over my countertops and under my wall cabinets.  Going to return this and try a masticating juicer.

Whatever happened to Cuisinart? We used to think of them as precision products. We noticed it too late - we were all set to eat - so the forks slid all around and got mixed up. We all got a good laugh out of it.  In the end though, we have an inferior product. Wondering if this was a second. I cannot imagine this got past quality control. And there would be many like this."

    "output": "First impressions: The rice from this cooker is delicious and the process was very simple after discovering that long-grain rice, which is what I eat, is the exception rather than the rule for this cooker.  On the Quick Start Guide, a single sheet added to the enclosed paperwork,  (and not anywhere in the manual that I could find) it states that the cooker is designed for short and medium grain rice.  The Quick Start Guide says that long-grain rice should be cooked using the Mixed rice setting.  Fine, except that in the smaller print of the operating manual it says that the Timer function, which I'd like to use, is not available for Mixed rice.  So if I want to use the Timer I will either have to switch  to small/medium grain rice or find a White rice setting that works equally well.  According to the manual, Mixed rice requires about 30 minutes of pre-heating time, so that must be the requirement for long grain rice.I was also disappointed to find that if and when the battery needs to be replaced it is not a simple DIY operation.  Videos of owners attempting to replace the battery themselves (not recommended by the manufacturer) show total disassembly of the cooker and the very careful, precise use of a soldering iron and other tools to replace the battery which is soldered directly to a printed circuit board.  For most owners this will no doubt require shipping their cooker to a repair facility just to replace a battery.  As I said, disappointing from a design standpoint.  Battery life is estimated at 4-5 years if the unit is left unplugged.  Maybe at that point it will be time for a new cooker anyway, but I hope to get more years from this investment so I'll keep my unit plugged in to save the battery.I am very happy with the rice from this cooker and would not want to discourage anyone from purchasing this fine product.  It is easy to use, easy to clean and has produced excellent servings of rice for me.  I did want to point out a couple things that I was not aware of prior to purchase.Update #1After some experimentation I find that I can make wonderful long grain rice using the White rice setting.  I start by thoroughly rinsing the rice in the excellent Oxo rice washing colander until the water is clear.  To cook I use a ratio of 1 water to 1 rice using the cup included with the cooker to measure both which is slightly less water than using the line on the bowl.  The result is rice with separate grains instead of stickier rice.  I tried using medium grain rice but that does produce a sticky rice that is perfect for chopsticks but not what I usually want.  Using the White rice setting has also allowed me to use the Timer function which is very useful.Update #2It's been a couple months now.  I've continued to experiment with the water amount and the settings.  I find that I can get the exact texture of rice I want by using the amount of water indicated by the lines on the bowl along with the White Rice - SOFTER setting.  This seems to work perfectly for both long-grain and medium-grain rice.  I've also made yellow rice, substituting chicken broth for water and adding some spices prior to cooking, also using the SOFTER setting.  It's great."

It also does a good job of keeping the rice warm, and it is very easy to remove and wash the inner lid along with the rice cooking pot, which is a big improvement on our previous rice cooker. We have cooked takikomi gohan in this rice cooker and it also came out great. The only minor quibble I have with this rice cooker so far is that the buttons are quite hard to press without also moving the whole rice cooker, and the button labels were slightly confusing so I had to read the (quite well written) instructions before using it."

This product is everything I expected and even more. For the price of 49 dollars this rice cooker is a great value producing perfect rice every time. I have made rice of all kinds in this cooker. Long grain, brown, Basmati, Jasmine and even the Royal Blend rices. I have steamed vegetables, and a bonus, this cooker makes great oatmeal, including absolutely delicious steel cut(Irish) oats. When cooking oatmeal one reviewer suggested not putting the lid on tight and that keeps it from boiling over. It works!! We use this cooker almost daily and it is easy to clean. When done you retract the cord and just put it away. I suppose I could say it doesn't do this or that but I knew its limitations before I purchased it. Therefore this review is based on what I knew I was getting. Bottom line is if you want to spend 200 dollars on a rice cooker go ahead but I am more than satisfied with this 49 dollar purchase."

There is a plastic ring in the metal tube that connects to the motor, I guess plastic is the ideal material for that particular spot.  (it looks like a washer) I don't really know what it does though. For my diet, I have to eat 3-4 oz of chicken breasts  4 times a day, I used to get so tired of eating flavorless chicken.  Now I just ground up all the chicken breasts and make a delicious, healthy and hearty chili.  The flavors get into every bit of the ground chicken.  The texture and looseness of the ground chicken is just easier for me to swallow the food and stick to my diet.No problems with clogging yet even though I ran some pork butt and pork belly (which is like 50% fat) through it to make sausages for my friend, I do put the blade and plate and other metal parts beside the hopper into the freezer for about 20 mins before I use it, and partially freeze the meats too, as many tips have suggested.I am taking 1 star off because my food pusher arrived broken in two pieces, but thank goodness it wasn't too important of a part of the machine so I just kept it."

Was concerned a bit about capacity, but it's more than enough for meals for a family of four. You will want to hand wash the inner pan. The serving scoop / rice fluffer is useful and easy to clean. Have used only on the Pre-Washed setting and it took a couple of runs before we got the rice:water ratio just right, but once dialed in, the result is consistent - evenly cooked rice with an excellent texture. I have previous experience cooking rice in a general-purpose steamer, and this is a solid step up in terms of simplicity, and a minor step up in terms of the quality of its output. Keep warm function does a good job keeping the rice from drying out, but typically use this only for 1-2 hours max, so can't attest to longer periods. I have noticed recently that the unit will trap some moisture in the lid above the seal (where the steam vents) and this did cause some worry when water leaked out and we initially could not tell where it was coming from. Overall, if you are determined to buy a rice cooker, this is a good (expensive) option."

Like electric skillets, the heating coil is either full on or full off, but the temp control knob with indicator light lets you select the best cooking temp. The heating coil cycles on & off, as does the temp selection indicator light. The metal pot is approx 8\" at the bottom and 10\" at the top and has 3 rests to keep the lid elevated about 1/16\" to prevent steam buildup inside. There's still enough steam for stir fry and potstickers. The grill lines keep bacon and burgers from sitting in grease. The removable pot cleans easily and quickly, and clicks into the plastic base. The base stays cool while cooking but the counter surface below can get very warm. I can't say enough good things about this cooker! Easy clean up, so versatile and portable which is awesome for camping. It's lightweight and stores easily in the camper. I lined the pot to protect the non stock surface from scratches while the cord is stored inside."

Not a bad product, but I might buy something else if I had seen a demo product before purchase."

First off, it's messy and labor intensive to clean. You know a product is going to be high maintenance when comes with its own special cleaning tools (cleaning brush was included). Pulp ends up everywhere (even when properly assembled). Also, it easily gets thrown off balance and will literally start jumping around on the counter and you have to hold it down with two hands while someone else puts the ingredients in and pushes them down with the plunger. One time, it even projectile shot an entire lemon wedge back out which hit the kitchen ceiling. Oh, and it sounds like an airplane taking off.... it will literally wake up everyone in the house.

I like the adjustable heat option for desired crispness; it is easy to clean up after use and it stands up nicely for narrow storage places; it is a reliable brand, and the price was great.

I expect this one to last a long time too. Time will tell.UPDATE!I'm sad to say that this new mixer was a disappointment. I expected it to be as good as the original I had for decades but right out of the box it had a bad vibration. I inspected it to see if anything was loose and also compared it with the old one including using the beater from the old one. Same result. Bad vibration and loud running. It could have been a one-time deal but since it vibrated at first power up, I have to assume it was not tested after assembly or the tester didn't care. I returned it for a refund.

It's easy to use, has a spoon holder and a handle (two things I didn't know I needed on a rice cooker), it keeps rice warm without burning the bottom of the pot, the inside lid is easy to remove and put back on.Bonus: sings a song when rice is ready.The one thing I don't like: the price. Let's be honest, no one likes spending that much on small kitchen appliances. It's like paying 200$ for a toaster. Sounds insane. But sometimes it's worth paying a bit more to have a quality product that will last a long time. I bought 5 Black&Decker rice cookers at canadian tire over the course of 6 years (30$ each) and 4 of them stopped working after less than a year. Instead of wasting so much money on a cheap model, I should've bought this one from the start.Bottom line: Love it, worth it, just buy it?"

DO NOT purchase!: Summary: DO NOT buy this rice cooker.Zojirushi rice cookers have been famously known as being the best rice cookers out there. I invested in one thinking this was the undeniable truth. Unfortunately, for a nearly $200 rice cooker, this was not the case.I have had the same rice cooker since my family moved to the USA in 1986 and it still works great. It's a cheap Oster rice cooker that never burns rice and always cooks it perfectly. Other cookers I've bought have never panned out, so I always went back to my Oster. My parents came over one weekend to visit and were surprised that I was still using the old Oster and bought this Zojirushi for me from Amazon that same night. It arrived 2 days later thanks to Prime and has been an excellent rice cooker.Being an investment, I took great care of it... I washed it with a soft wash cloth and used minimal, mild soapy water (per directions). Less than a year later (approximately 9 months), I notice the Teflon has begun to come off the bottom. I NEVER us any other utensil other than the provided rice scooper to remove rice from the cooker.It's so disappointing that a highly touted rice cooker has worn faster than a 30 year old rice cooker. I will NEVER buy a Zojirushi rice cooker again and am going back to my old, but reliable Oster rice cooker from 1986."

I also used the programmable time function quite a bit when I was working nights. Add the rice and water to the cooker and press a few buttons to have freshly made rice at the same time my alarm clock was going off in the afternoon. When I initially bought it, it was because I could never make a decent batch of rice. Since then I've been cooking all kinds of rice in this cooker and it always turns up perfectly. That's because all I do now is add my ingredients and press a button and this really smart cooker does all the work. The price is high and hasn't changed much in about 5 years (in fact I think I paid the same for it, about $180), but if mine broke I would buy another one just like it in a heartbeat."

    "output": "This may be my most used appliance: I live in a desert, where appliance cooking makes total sense.  Because I take pains to avoid adding unnecessary heat to our cottage for most of the year, I have gone through a a variety of electric skillets and Foreman grills, in search of the just-right-for-my-style-of-cooking-appliance.None have been completely satisfactory, for one reason or another, but this Aroma mult-pot is almost perfect in all the important ways.I bought it as  a warehouse deal, knowing I was taking a chance.  Who among us has not received a broken or defective product returned by some earlier buyer?  But the price was low enough that I was willing to gamble.Sure enough, the pot arrived with a the broken plastic housing on the control plug, but it was nothing a dab of epoxy glue couldn't fix.  I was too eager to put it to work to be arsed to send it back.It has been used almost daily since then.  It  is much more versatile than a panini press type grill and a perfect  size for a two-person household. Last night I grilled some burgers and then browned chicken cubes for tonight's chicken verde.  I cooked up a mess of bacon in it this morning. I'll make braised escarole and beans tomorrow night and grilled cheese sandwiches the next. It will be used for a Halloween houseparty hotpot at the end of this month.This is how I  know I have found a really \"good,\" or, at least, good-for-me appliance...something about it encourages it's frequent use. This three-in-one superpot is my new favorite in that regard. Move on over, egg cooker/single serve broccoli steamer!Some reviewers say  these are \"flimsy\" appliances,  but they are judging this pot by its cover. Yes, the surrounding frame is plastic, but it is not likely to break unless it is severely abused.  It is advertised as being dishwasher proof but it is easier to wipe it down after each use.The cooking portion is a snap to remove and replace and (relatively) easy to clean.  I also appreciate the indicator light on the dial, which makes it easy to fine tune low temperature cooking. The overall temperature control is very responsive, with the unit heating up and cooling down quickly and the non-stick finish is superb.But the top selling point (Grill Marks!) is also  my top gripe. Those luscious bown marks come from ridges. Ridges make it difficult to spatula out leftover grease, and demand the melt and pour method of cleaning, vs. the scrape and dunk method.  Being firmly in the former camp, I want this with a flat bottom pan, and a removable ridged insert for the occaisional times when really want  Grill Marks!  I would even pay full price for it.But until then, I will just have to make do with my nearly almost perfect Grillette. Life is tough, I tell ya."

I love that there are indentations to evenly space the \"spears\"and keep them from moving around so you don't lose track of the order you put them in. Colors help you remember what was on each stick. Only complaints are: I wish the cord was a bit longer, but it's not ridiculously short either and I don't believe there is a way to detach the pot form the base and I feel wierd washing it with the heating element and power cord input still attached.

Fondue should be an experience, not just a meal.  I have other Cuisinart products, and am happy with them all.  This one, not so much.  First, it's enormous.  At three quarts, you need to feed at least six to eight people to get the liquid in the pot to cover whatever it is you are fondue-ing.  I prefer a little more of an intimate setting.  Next, the temperature settings aren't very true.  There's a point between 3 and 3.5 where the heat goes from a gentle simmer to a raging boil, and there's no in-between.  Very difficult get the meat to the temp you want when you never know what the temp is actually going to be.  Lastly, the cord for this unit is about a foot long at best.  I don't know of anyone who has a plug directly on their table or likes to eat next to a wall just to get an outlet.  I had to use an extension cord, and the weight of the cord kept pulling the plug out of the pot and making it slowly sneak off the table.  Bad situation all around.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that this baby is going back and I'm going to look for something a bit more stable."

With this blender you have to take it apart and stir it constantly for it to only get through HALF a smoothie and still very big frozen chunks. I tried several methods to no avail. I got so frustrated I threw it away after a couple of weeks (I had already used the blender and thrown away the box so didn't think I could return it). This was such a big waste of money. And for many mornings, a huge waste of time and discomfort (since I didn't have a full smoothie to consume while at work)."

    "output": "Simply Amazing! (14 Years Later): This rice cooker makes the best rice we have ever had - at least since our travels to Southeast Asia.  And despite the fact that this machine *seems* smarter than it's user, it is remarkably simple to operate.  The instruction book lacks a little bit in terms of recipes and creativity - but it does a good job giving you the basic idea of how to use this machine.  This space age looking rice cooker is a little pricey, so it may be overkill for some - but I love all the features this offers and consider it well worth the price (which is a hundred less than what it is offered for here at Amazon).  We eat a lot of brown rice, which is not something that other rice cookers handle well.  This one has a setting for brown rice, and cooks it to perfection.  Also has a setting for semi-brown rice, sushi rice, porridge & more.  You get to pick how soft or hard you want the rice to turn out by using the control panel.  Being able to set a timer for having rice ready when we get home from work is handy.  This thing also cooks complete meals - definitely get a good cookbook for rice cooker cooking :-)  We are expirimenting with many varieties of rice that I normally would have shyed away from, since I could not seem to cook even plain old brown rice properly until now.It took me 6 months to decide to buy this thing.  We were originally contemplating the MYC10 series, but the specific settings for brown rice became important to us.  And this one takes up less space on the countertop than the MYC10.  We will be eating rice nearly every day now thanks to this machine!  I am definitely glad we chose the ZAC10, and would recommend this product.  It's a keeper!UPDATED JUNE 12, 2004:  We have now had this rice cooker for nearly a year, and have used it at least 3 times a week.  It has held up to regular use quite well, we have not had a single problem with it.  If anything, we are eating at home more than ever because of the simplicity of planning meals ahead of time.  One thing that we have learned is that the 5 cup capacity is for using the cooker for white rice.  Brown rice capacity is about 3 cups.  So if you anticipate using this for more than 3 6 oz. cups of dry brown rice, you might consider steppig up to the 10 cup capacity model ZAC18.  One tip for making very tasty rice, use a broth instead of water (or 1/2 and 1/2).  If you are on fence about this cooker go ahead and take the leap - it is fantastic!  No regrets!UPDATED April 18, 2008:  Well, the \"Brown Rice\" setting finally died this week after nearly five (yes FIVE!) faithful years of weekly use.  We remain very pleased with this product, and plan to upgrade to the newest model in a 10 cup capacity.UPDATED May 24, 2017:  We never discarded this after buying the newer 10 cup model. Hard to believe this rice cooker is as old as our youngest teenager and still gets regular use on the white rice setting!  The only setting that doesn't work is brown rice... and we use our larger 10 cup version for that. One of the best kitchen gadgets we have ever purchased!"

I find that when you put something in the juicer it will sometimes just send it to pulp area without even juicing it. I previously had a Lalanne, i think its called. And loved it till one of the plastic pieces broke that i couldn't replace.This one, it  does not juice the green stuff. Mint, Parsley spinach, You barely get a thing out of those. Mint you get nothing. My last juicer mint was delicious when juiced. Plus one lady mentioned the noise. Correct. A Ton of noise, sometimes you think the whole machine is going to take off or break apart with the noise. I am very disappointed bearing in mind the amount of fantastic reviews it had. I do juice a lot and I sincerely would not recommend this machine.If I had paid a lot less for this machine. I would have thought Ok, you get what you pay for.... but at this price, I would have expected way better. :("

This morning it starting making a weird sound when I turned it on. So I turned it off, reassembled it, and started juiced. It ended up smoking and completely shut down, I juiced exactly 1 beet and 1 carrot. I am so so disappointed that it has died this quickly.

It adds a fun and playful touch to my kitchen and never fails to put a smile on my face. But what really sets this popper apart is its lightning-fast popping speed. In just a few short minutes, I can have a full bowl of perfectly popped popcorn ready to go.One thing I appreciate about the Presto Poplite is its compact size. It doesn't take up much counter space, making it perfect for small kitchens or apartments. And when I'm done using it, the popper is easy to clean and store away.But let's talk about the popcorn itself. The Presto Poplite produces fluffy, evenly cooked popcorn every time. And because it uses hot air instead of oil, it's a healthier option for those watching their calorie intake. Plus, I love that I can control the amount of butter and seasoning I add to my popcorn, giving me endless flavor options.Overall, I highly recommend the Presto Poplite Popper to anyone looking for a fast, convenient, and delicious way to enjoy popcorn. Trust me, once you try this popper, you'll never go back to microwave popcorn again!"

We only use it for rice however, and so we always turn the dial all the way around. We chose this steamer over conventional rice steamers because we *didn't* want it to keep the rice warm - it just shuts off. (We make rice every night before going to bed for our dogs' food - don't ask!) We haven't used it for veggies, so can't comment on the performance there, but it does a fine job on rice. Though it does take an hour, much longer than stove-top or dedicated rice-steamers. But for us it's a set-it and forget-it type of thing."

    "output": "Excellent rice cooker: This is a fantastic little gadget. I use it primarily to cook basmati rice and steel-cut oats. My favorite feature is that I can set it to be ready-to-eat when I choose, meaning I can have hot oatmeal ready to eat first thing in the morning, or a pot of rice steamed for dinner in the evening. All it requires is a little planning ahead. The cord is retractable, and everything that comes with the rice cooker (save the manuals) fits neatly inside the rice cooker, making it portable and compact, great for a small kitchen.My minor complaints are that its internals are all hand-wash only, and that the steel-cut oatmeal is a little dense and drier than I would prefer straight from the pot when prepared as recommended. This is easily rectified with a splash of water or milk once removed from the cooker. Given that the pot is a very nice nonstick, washing it by hand isn't the worst thing. Rice and oatmeal come out very easily and with minimal, if any, scrubbing. This cooker does not have features for steaming vegetables or meat, which I don't find terribly detracting as I'd rather have a great one function device than an underperforming two function device. I also find that the \"stay cool\" handles aren't so much cool to the touch as cooler than the rest of the pot. The handles can be a bit unpleasantly warm to the bare hand, I don't feel these warrant taking off as star overall.For those who can afford this, I highly recommend this rice cooker, as the rice comes out great consistently and it has some really nice features. I also recommend keeping the original packaging for the rice cooker if you intend on moving frequently, or can't afford the counter space for the rice cooker all the time. Everything fits very compactly inside the unit, but the manuals and quick reference guides are immensely useful for taking the guesswork out of \"which setting do I choose?\", and having it inside its box makes it easy to both transport and store."

Love it!  Yes, it does boil over but if you put in a tablespoon of butter it only bubbles around the edge of the lid.  No problem making brown rice, never had a problem with it being dry on the bottom, no problem with the teflon.  One of the things I like best about it is that it's pretty much wipe and dry - so much easier to clean than the old aluminum cooker that had to be soaked for three hours.HOWEVER.  All of a sudden, two weeks ago, it stopped working.  Just stopped. The amber light would go on when it was plugged in, but the switch wouldn't go down to start the cycle.  Tried every outlet, yada yada yada.But hey!  It's got a warranty!  Yes.  They will replace it if it breaks within three years.Of course, you have to pay them $10 first or they won't ship it to you, and you have to pay to ship it back to them, so you're essentially just getting a discount on a new cooker.But then there's more!  The warranty on the new cooker - get this - goes to the end of the three years on the original purchase, not three years for the new cooker.  That is how unreliable they think their own product is.  They're really just renting it to you for three years.  I fully expect this replacement to last another 18 months, at which time I will read reviews before I buy a different brand.I was surprised, because my other Cuisinart products have not had any problems.  However, I don't use those every single day like I do the rice cooker.  I think this is made to be displayed with one's other chrome appliances, and not actually intended to be used to, you know, cook rice."

Even totally winging it, this cooker produced perfect brown rice, so I was sold. Now I finally have my own and so far it has been amazing!

Do yourself a favor and save your money and get in the habit of buying low sodium V-8 and regularly eating vegetables with your meals."

Pretty sure that the shoot is sized to match the machines ability to process no more than what can be fed through the tiny feed tube. Labored through celery and gave up trying to stuff spinach. The extruded pulp was very wet and was able to squeeze considerable juice from it by hand. This particular unit did not live up to its reputation."

Where in the world did the quality of Cuisinart go? I have no idea how this small appliance received high reviews; unless, in the interim of those reviews and my purchase, manufacturing has changed. Additionally, no “how-to” pamphlet included which might be a fluke - or - something to consider for first-time small appliance users. No warranty card included either. Already filled out the form to return this product. You are better off shopping a brick and mortar store; and checking out these small appliances in person.

I cautiously dropped in like two grapes, I got a little juice out of them but the machine got louder and started vibrating a lot. Im like oh okay yeah lets turn it off. I turned it off, then turned back on to try one more little grape. Then, i literally kid you not, the thing vibrated back and forth so hard that it started to “walk”. Incredible...just waddling towards me (and the edge of the counter) like a zombie nightmare! The walking brev! Anyways I got so freaked out I turned it off and immediately packed it into the original packaging to return it. I rarely comment on amazon btw lolol so you know I mean it!

I SAVED THAT PAPER.Immediately after use I wash the blade, dry it thoroughly and let finish air drying for another half hour or so while cleaning up. Then I rub a thin coating of olive (can use other kind as well) on the blade, wrap it in the original `oily' paper and STORE INSIDE THE PUSHER.It doesn't say so in the instructions, but I'm sure that was the intention of the design of the pusher. The sausage attachment goes in first, then the 3 blades wrapped in the oily paper. I snap the lid back on and everything is there easily accessible. No need to store these blades in a separate bag of rice.So far I've used the grinder 4 times in two months (grinding a boneless leg of lamb, beef roast - along with onion/celery, and pork) all with excellent results and have not had a rusty blade yet.I agree with everything positive said so far. This grinder also looks exceptionally  beautiful, works effortlessly and is easy to assemble and clean up afterwards. I am VERY satisfied with the whole unit - the eye appeal and the performance!"

    "input": "",
    "output": "Yes, the price sucks, but I love it.: I hear a lot of people talking about how it makes fluffy rice, but personally, I like my jasmine (fragrant) rice on the stickier side. So the trick is to leave it in the cooker on the keep warm setting after it finishes cooking. I do so for at least 2 hours. The texture is amazing. I liked rice before and would have it every week. Now, I have it every day.Important things to know:- It can only make 4 cups (uncooked) jasmine rice. So the 5.5 cup capacity doesn't apply to all types of rice.- The 10 cup version is actually cheaper, so if 4 cups of jasmine rice aren't enough for you, you might want to go for the 10 cup one and save a few bucks at the same time.- It has handles that stay cool, unlike some of the other Zojirushi models.- Has a very handy automatically retractable power cord.Even my boyfriend raved about the rice's texture (and he is not the type to pay attention to that kind of detail). I used to own a cheap rice cooker that cost under 20$. It depends on how picky you are. Sometimes I would hurt my teeth on the uncooked rice of that cheaper machine. The Neuro Fuzzy cooks rice really evenly. None of it sticks to the bottom to form a hard crust.I actually bought a Panasonic Fuzzy Logic rice cooker a few years back (retailing at around 100$) and I returned it to the store, as it couldn't deliver texture-wise."

The reviews I read here from the fellow chicken neck grinders led me to this product.One other note: The blade on this grinder is very different from the hand grinder. On the hand grinder, there was more of an angle to the edge, and I found that by sharpening it on a flat stone, it would make the job easier. On this grinder, the blade edges are ~90 degrees, so sharpening does little good.As other reviews stated, this product is certainly NOT \"professional\" grade. I do think it would be much stronger if not grinding something as tough as chicken necks.Time will tell.09/25/15 Update: Still grinding away. Probable do about 30 lbs. of chicken thighs(w/ bones) a month. I do sharpen the blade on a stone w/ each use. I was surprised this would last this long."

The rice doesn't even need seasoning - the long steaming process brings out the flavor in a way that quick cooking never can.I upgraded from a basic Z rice steamer, which made good rice, but was such a mess to clean up after...and could not be used as a warmer for long periods.  While the Neuro Fuzzy is expensive, I figured I would eat a good deal more rice, oatmeal, and steamed Asian-style dishes if I had an easy-to-use cooker.

It's much, much quieter then the one I was using, although it does take a little longer, and i have to cut my fruits and veggies to fit in the hopper. I don't mind this and I should follow my sister-in-laws advice and cut multiple days worth ahead of time. I tried making the banana ice cream, and that just amazed me. I did use a smaller mesh strainer from the suggestions of other reviewers.So far I have mostly juiced with it. I did the banana ice cream and even added raw cocoa powder to make it chocolate ice cream, that was successful. I want to make cookies out of the pulp but I am not that brave yet. I tried making almond butter,and I believe it will work, but I needed to add oil, and I only had olive oil. I didn't like the taste of that and will probably try again with almond oil. I created a juice recipe I actually love... all veggies and 1/2 a pear.... which along with carrots seems to make any combo of veggies taste good to me. I drink about 1 1/2 cups of raw veggie juice a day as part of my therapy to rid myself of cancer. My new oncologist thinks I am doing well, and has encouraged me to keep this going along with a... no sugar, alkaline, vegitarian diet. \"Only from the Earth\" is his motto. This juicer has become a major part of my path to wellness. I am truly loving this juicer!"

The rice container scratches easier that the NS-ZCC10. NS-ZCC10 Looks well made. One star for that.Durability: NS-RNC 18A Used daily for 15 yrs and was still working properly when replaced. Of course the rice container needs replacing already. But the unit itself was still working like new. NS-ZCC10 Lasted 3 yrs of daily use. Early this year it started not to cook the rice like it used to. It dries up the rice and it makes the top and sides of the cooked rice hard and gummy.Cooking time: NS-RNC 18A: less than 25 minutes NS-ZCC10: 45 minutesCooked White Rice Quality: The same ( I haven't tried cooking brown rice on NS-RNC 18A )Origin: NS-RNC 18A: Made in Thailand NS-ZCC10: Made in JapanAs of today I got my new NS-RNC 18A to replace my NS-ZCC10 which does look nicer but overprice to last only for 3 yrs."

So I know what I'm talking about. I tried slicing a loaf of fresh (just-baked) French bread and after two slices my hands were exhausted. (One hand holds the knife and the other holds the loaf of bread.)Also: the blades were shorter than my previous one, so they did not even reach all the way through the bread slicing guide.Even worse: after two slices there was a smell of hot plastic/overheating motor, which considerably reduced the pleasure of eating toasted and buttered French bread.Also: the teeth were not sharp. Is this a safety feature? They would not cut through the crust. I set this electric knife aside and used my non-electric serrated bread knife, and it made slices on the same loaf quickly and with ease. So it's not a problem with the bread!!I'm not going to bother returning it: I don't want to waste another moment thinking about this ridiculously poorly designed piece of engineering and throw it straight in the trash.I did give it one star because some people might find it useful on a soft bread like carrot bread or banana bread.

It took about 20 minutes to juice the carrots, including the time to re-juice the pulp to get every drop of that orange gold out.But that is not how with works with the Breville, friends. No, you drop the carrots into that beautiful vegetable-crushing vortex -- yes, even the FAT carrots that you had to slice thinner before so they would fit -- and WHOOSH, in two seconds that carrot has been Fargo'd. It's a thing of beauty. So now juicing five pounds of carrots takes maybe five minutes, and you do NOT have to re-juice the remnants because they are already just about powder-dry.So, point-blank, if you want a FAST juicer that gets ALL of the juice out with one pass, this juicer is for you. Absolutely, 100% recommend."

    "output": "Been using for 2 years. Works wonderfully. Love it!!!: First of all, I've been having this rice cooker for 2 years and I don't have any problems with it. :)))I've been feeding on rice as major dish since I could remember, so I'm very picky with the taste and structure of rice. I could tell the difference of good and fresh new rice from others that are not. That's probably why I couldn't make my peace with those simply made Aroma or other american brand cookers. I've tried them all. Yet I just couldn't feel the happiness and satisfaction when I'm using those rice cookers, like the feeling when encountered with delicious food which tastes exactly the same as mom's cooking. So I decided to find an Asian product from China or Japan where people rely on rice as major dish. And I found this on Amazon! Before purchasing, I did some research to make sure. Based on the positive reviews and the fact that Zojirushi is a famous brand in Japan, I figured why not. I'm glad that I did!I've a small family, only me and hubby, so this 5 1/2 cup sized rice cooker fits us perfectly. Normally I set a timer for morning the night before, and the timer indicates when the rice would be ready. It's a very handy function to have for morning cooking. Set it up for 8 am and you'll get rice freshly made ready on 8 am without having to get up 50 minutes earlier to press the cooker on the go. I make bento boxes for my hubby and myself, that's why I really need the timer function.This cooker actually allows you to set 2 timers according to different purposes. It also has different modes as regular, soft, quick cooking, porridge and more. It comes with measuring cups as well. This measuring cups means usual cups as a literal container, not the US measurement method cups. I've seen people getting confused in the review, so I'd like to clarify a little. So if you use the 1 Cup measurement cup to fill rice, it would NOT be the same and in fact, much more than the cooker cup fills. Therefore, stick to the cooker cup for measuring rice would be helpful. What I normally do is to place the cup in the rice container, therefore I've easy access to it and don't need to look for it every time.I've been using this rice cooker on daily base for 2 years and I don't have any problems with it. The only minor thing that I could think of is the monitor not being backlit. Actually I was a little disappointed at first when I knew about it from the reviews, since I thought that'd be a big deal. But as it turns out I wasn't affected by it as much as I expected. So I've made my peace with it. :)))Plus, I've been relocated twice during these years and every time I got relocated, I've packed it up and stored it in a garage for about 3 months. And when I get it out from the package, the monitor time is still running and I've had no problems with the indicator ever. I've seen people complaining about the battery in the review, maybe I haven't encountered with the problem yet since it's only been 2 years. But I think after unplugging for 3 months and still working would mean something.One last thing I wanted to mention is that this rice cooker is easy for cleaning as well. That should be credited to the removable lit.Overall, after 2 years of happy rice time with my rice cooker, I've decided to give it a 5 star review and share my experience with others. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good quality rice cooker and has a small family or just occasionally eat rice. I'm glad with my purchase!"

The key is to do it first thing in the morning and drink the juice before you eat or drink anything and in just a few short days you will feel like you never have before. I think of it as a jump start for the day, it wakes up your brain and gets your organs off to a great start, it also does wonders for your eye sight. Google ABC health benefits for more information."

We now hardly ever eat out and buying ingredients for a rice cooked meal is MUCH cheaper. In the long run we are saving money. I use this cooker every other day and it's been about a month. I chop up vegetables and a protein of choice sauteed on the side for a perfect healthy meal. I have yet to make porridge and bread/cake in this thing but I hear you can and I can't wait to try it!

First, the noise is literally louder than a lawn mower, I’m not being funny or Exaggerating, it hurts my ears to be near it and I’m 31 yes old. When you actually put vegetables and fruit in it the sound gets even crazier, which is even hard to believe since it’s at like a level 11 to begin with. Secondly, it’s is a complete danger to use. The bin can hold an amount of pulp to fill the juice catch but most of the time half way through the machine GETS EVEN LOUDER and flies OFF THE COUNTER. This thing is like 10 pounds of steel (more or less it’s really heavy)!! I bought this for my father that had double knee replacement so that he could juice and help with inflammation. I thank god that I used this for him the first time to show him because if he had used it himself he wouldn’t have been fast enough to press the emergency off button. He seriously may have never been able to walk again or worse. The thought of it makes me sick. I only bought this model because of the color, as we have little storage space and it sits on the counter permanently and wanted to look nice and for the amount of money it cost, it is the scariest thing to use. I have been meaning to post this for a while, but I still have it and use it because I can’t return it and it costs so much. I need to create a barrier with my coffee machine so it doesn’t fly off the counter and kill my dog. I would have returned it but I threw away the box and and used it before I realized it is a death trap."

I was totally blown away about how FRESH it tastes... And, most importantly, cleaning the juicer was also EASY ... I am now truly looking forward to my juicing jouri...

The top plate never releases the waffle and often clamps closed and that requires you to unplug the device and literally pry the upper and lower plates apart with a screwdriver. Obviously, you get no waffles.Bottom line: When your old Toastmaster dies, find another device to make waffles. This will only break your heart."

Another thing I realize is that the juicer is very portable, and it can go on road trips. The last convincing test was when I juiced berries in a fast juicer and it strewed the berries everywhere-inside the cutting basket and on the inside container. I juiced the same type of berries in the Omega and the pulp came out dry and the cleanup was SO easy. I do not regret my decision at all. This juicer is efficient, portable, and respects fruits and veggies. Stop living life in the fast lane, slow down to reap all of its benefits...one will receive two rewards great juice and eatable pulp."

    "output": "Love this rice cooker: I've had this rice cooker for three years, using it every other day and haven't had a problem with it. I use it to mainly cook brown rice of various kinds (which takes around 1 hour and 50 min to cook brown rice)  and I have cooked white rice with it (takes around 50 min ) and both come out perfectly. Couldn't care less if the battery wears out (it hasn't so far) as I never use the timer feature.  Very easy to use and clean. The bowl is non-stick and the inner lid is removable for cleaning. You need to use the little cup it comes with to measure your rice and the cup holds 150 ml or close to 2/3 of a cup. Once it is finished cooking, it switches to a warm mode and shows the time it is in warm mode by the hour. This cooker is  far superior to cooking rice on the stove, oven or using the cheap rice cooker I use to have. I would highly recommend it. Update six years after buying it , the battery died, but I just plug it into an outlet, reset the clock and menu and it's good to go. My non-stick pan looks brand new. I just clean it with a nylon scrubbie and I store the cooked rice in another pan. I suppose it is just habit from when I cooked rice on the stove top. Still happy with my purchase."

The rice is perfect every time and hassle free, just give the rice a rinse, fill water to the appropriate line, and push the button.  The included instructions were fool-proof.  It has a lot of character for a small appliance between its cute squat appearance and the little jingle it plays when the rice is done - my fiance and I lovingly refer to it as Zoji!  Most of the time we leave it on the counter because we eat rice constantly now that it's so easy to make, but I really appreciate the retractable cord and that all the \"accessories\" fit inside the machine for storage."

I was more surprised to find that the markings on the temperature dial were so far off, they might as well not have been there. I think that with some trial and error this will be a good little griddle i hope.Checking temperatures with an inferred thermometer, i found that the coolest spot was right where the control plugged into the unit. The hottest spot was the furthest point right above the point where you plug in the control. When i first rotate the dial with a cold plate the light comes on about half way between off and warm. After about 1 minute i checked the temperatures and they ran around 215 to 255 at different spots. With the dial set to 200 i was in the 305 to 376 range. With the dial set to 400 i was shocked to see the temperature readings i was getting. They ran from 465 to 612.  The 612 reading was the hot spot described above and the temperature light had just turned off . With your hand 12 to 15 inches held above this unit, you can feel this thing cranking out the heat. I don't see me ever cooking anything above the warm setting.People need to always be careful with any item that heats up for cooking and not leave them unattended.

It is not too hard to clean if you clean it immediately. You have 6 parts to clean, only one takes a little elbow grease that is the mesh basket/blade which needs to be cleaned well with the provided brush, every thing else is a quick sponging rinse.

    "output": "Helpful Little Cooker!: I purchased this unit and after reading the other reviews, I was a little ambivalent as to how useful it would be. I decided to give a try for myself. It is great help to be able to cook rice/pasta and not have to worry about the food burning because it was left the stove on too long. However, there a couple of things that detract from its usefulness. If you are cooking something with just one or one and a half cups of liquid, then it is not a problem. When you cook more than that amount, the liquid will boil over. When I cook something that requires more liquid (such as risotto) I  leave the lid off and that way, it does not boil over. It does sort of defeat the purpose of \"steaming\" rice rather than \"boiling\" rice, but it is a lot less messy. Secondly, the pot insert which is supposed to be non-stick surface is very thinly coated and mine has already been scratched on the bottom. The thought that I have ingested that coating with my food does not make for a very appetizing nor healthy meal! The steam insert is great to have, as you can put the veggies into the steamer and put that on top of the cook pot while the rice is cooking. My suggestion to the manufacturer would be to redesign the steamer insert so that there is not a groove at the bottom which can trap food and bacteria and which is difficult to clean. Also, they should make the cook pot coating more durable so that it does not peel off with normal use. Apart from these two issues, I find that having a rice cooker/steamer is a very convenient item to have and the size of this particular cooker does not take up too much counter space and it pleasing to look at."

This is by far one of the best and most useful electric appliance purchases I've ever made.  I've been aware of rice cookers for a long time, but it never occurred to me that it would be something I'd use much.  I've always made pretty good rice on the stovetop and don't make it that often, so it didn't seem particularly necessary in my small kitchen.  But I kept reading about them, and a friend told me how she keeps brown rice going in hers and she and her husband cook veggies and bit of meat and fish and top the rice with it for quick weeknight dinners.  I also wanted to be able to have brown rice more often for dinner but would avoid it because it takes too long to cook stovetop on a weeknight.So I started doing research (I research all my cookware and appliances to within an inch of their lives).  For my needs, which included brown rices, good oatmeal, and other grains, it soon seemed that a fuzzy logic model would be the right one.

Great value, the warranty is terrific, the machine is solid and MOST importantly...it is easy to clean! I am currently on a juice fast and so I use and clean this thing 5 times a day. It's a breeze. I know that some people complain about the small 'ish' chute. I don't find it to be a big deal. I think that the chute size is relative to how much should be juiced at a time. I have no complaints, not one. I would recommend it and I would buy it again."

I switched to Bissell Crosswave All-in-One wet-dry cleaner thinking it will last longer because it is almost double the price.  Bissell lasts just over 1 year as well.  Bissell's suction is even less powerful.  I will never buy a BISSELL floor cleaner again.Since I am tired of Hoover floor mate durability, so I went back to mopping.  After a year on manual mopping, the floor is never as clean.  So I decided to get back to Hoover Floor Mate thinking Hoover has improved its durability in the last 3 years?  I hope this machine will last at least another 2 years or MORE!!!Hoover, please copy Dyson's philosophy and build a durable machine.  You are the best in hardwood floor cleaning machine, but you have a HUGE issue in the product durability!"

I bought, washed and cut up all sorts of fruits and veggies and went to start the new juicer and the EXACT same thing happened. It won’t work.

It's more expensive but you get what you pay for. Ours is in use almost constantly in our 5 person fil-am household. Unfortunately so much use has dried out the seal on the inner lid. I am taking away 1 star not because the seal failed but because this part has been unavailable on the Zojirushi website or anywhere for months. Highly recommend this product."

So I really wanted to buy a superb rice cooker (without super price) and I can sincerely say \"This Is It!\"Compared to the old rice cooker we have been using, the difference is noticeable. Each rice grain looks standing up and it looks beautiful (and tasty). I only tried regular/sushi but when I made sushi using the mode, it came out great too. I am very satisfied with the purchase."

The Cuisinart cooked a cup of rice in about 15 minutes.  The Hamilton Beach in about 30 minutes.  I believe due to the hotter cooking temperature of the Cuisinart, water boils more violently thus cause the steam to splatter (Cuisinart has a direct glass lid which has a hole in it for steam to escape, but when there were too much steam, the hole could not handle and cause steam to escape everywhere.  The Hamilton Beach has a locked lid, so steam would be channeled to the capturing cup on the side instead of splattering around the lid.Each model has its own advantages.  The Cuisinart has a see-through glass lid which, has a nicer stainless steel chassis, a simple Cook or Heat latch, and cooks faster.  The Hamilton Beach has a locked lid so steam doesn't splatter, comes with 5 control modes (white rice, whole grain, Hot Cereal, Steam, Warm) and a time-display window.  The keep warm feature on both are too warm, so they share the same disadvantage.My wife decided to keep them both.  The Hamilton will be used mainly for cooking rice, while the Cuisinart will be used for cooking other dishes (vegetables,..) since she can see what going on thru the glass lid."

Check.I bought this in 2017 and was happy. Then it broke during a move and I purchased the newer version (that does not look like this one at all). It was the worst! While it took whole fruits, it could barely juice a grape without struggling. I returned it and waited a few weeks to see this one drop in price.

This one is very easy to clean & doesn't make a huge mess like the Juiceman one I ended up returning to Costco before I bought this one.  I also love that it has a large opening in the top so if your apples & pears aren't too big, you don't have to bother cutting them up.  I go through phases, some months I'll make juice every day, then I get sick of cleaning it and stop for awhile.  Sooner than later though, I stop feeling all the benefits of the juices, so I end up pulling it right back out & starting up again.  Yeah, I complain about cleaning it, but as far as juicers go, this one is easy to clean.  I very highly recommend this, but just plan on it taking a good 20 minutes minimum (if you're super fast) to 30 minutes if you don't move fast in the morning like me) from start to finish.  I always clean it immediately, otherwise it's 10 times harder after the gunk has dried on it (you only make that mistake once)."

Other than that, I make sure to not store anything inside it but the vegetable steamer, and I don't use abrasive scrubbies to clean it. As others point out, it makes a mess on the countertop because the rim has bumps on it which don't allow the lid to sit tightly on top. There are other rice cookers out there that don't do that, so there is no reason to put up with that flaw, but if you do want to get this model, I solved the boil-over problem by replacing the lid with a silicone boil-over safeguard, available here on Amazon. And you can also use the safeguard on your spaghetti pot or anything else that tends to boil over!"

It keeps the rice warm for hours, and even gives you a display telling you exactly how long the rice has been kept warm for.  It has an alarm mode, so you can awaken to freshly cooked rice after setting up the rice cooker the night before.It does not make a crusty skin along the bottom of the pan either. There is  only just the slightest hint of the skin that forms.Cleanup is a breeze, involving using the paddle to scoop away any excess rice, then a brief rinse in water and 10 seconds of gentle sponging down (Don't scrub! you'll damage the non stick coating, and there is no need for abrasives at all.)"

I doubt I'd ever use an air fryer or pressure cooker but this thing is so slick and easy, I love it.Instructions are simple to follow for cooking basic rice and once you get comfortable with the settings, you can mix it up and add ingredients before cooking. I started with basic white sticky rice, about 50min to cook. Then I added some furikake (rice seasoning). Still awesome. Then I went into mexican style rice with tomato sauce, cumin, garlic powder, chicken bullion and tomato bullion. I failed the first time. came out crunchy when following the instructions for the water-to-rice ratio. But then I just went with a 1.5-to-1 water to rice and it came out awesome! And the timer is super accurate. I set it to be ready at 6pm (or 1800 hours since its only setting is 24hour clock), and it was done within about 2 minutes of the time.Point is, don't feel too bad if you're anxious around complicated cooking appliances. I still don't use any other button on a microwave besides the numbers for a nuking time. But if I could get the hang of this thing, then anyone can. :)P.S. You can cook other things in a rice cooker besides rice. It's basically a low temperature steamer. I'll try veggies later. Kinda wondering if i can bake a cake in it now. I'll experiment a little and see what happens."

    "output": "Life Can Be Good (Sometimes): My Zujirushi rice cooker arrived today, and I made my first batch of rice in it!  The machine is easy to set up and use.  I watched YouTube videos and read a lot of reviews before purchasing, so that gave me a leg up so to speak.Somehow I expected it to be a much heavier appliance than it is.  It is quite lightweight.  Everything so far seems to function as it should.  DO READ ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST, as did I, though, so you do not make any errors.After washing and drying the inner bowl, the rice paddle, and the removable lid, I used my rice washing bowl to wash two cups of Jasmine rice.  I never prepared Jasmine rice before in my life, although I am sure it must be the same rice I have eaten in Chinese and Thai restaurants many times.  It is at best a medium grain rice and much more sticky than the rice I usually eat, i.e. parboiled long grain rice.  Cooking the rice was a  breeze.  I put two cups of washed Jasmine rice in the inner bowl and added 2.5 cups of distilled water.  I set it for white rice and \"soft.\"  It took about 50 minutes to cook it which was fine with me as I had plenty of other things to do.  It turned out nicely, and I am going to use the leftovers to make fried rice, which I think I shall enjoy more.I used the Jasmine rice today as a base over which I spooned some tinned soup.  It is purely a matter of personal tase, but I much prefer my long grain parboiled rice over this Jasmine rice, at least for the types of meals I usually make, e.g. soups, creoles, seafood gumbo, as a side to veggie burgers, etc.  I just think the long grain parboiled rice is the most satisfying.  I suppose it may have something to do with how one was raised and how one has lived for most of one's life.Clean up was a breeze.  Set up and first use were easy (I read everything and read reviews and watched YouTube videos, so it did not seem like much of a challenge to first set up and use it).  I love the little tune played at the start and the end!  I HATE buzzers on microwaves and spin dryers, etc.  Why cannot they all use some little bit of music like this rice cooker uses?  It is so cheerful, and it does not make one jump out of one's skin to hear it.  Anyone who does not like the little tunes played at the start and the finish of a cooking cycle must be an old Grinch.I plan to make one cup of my parboiled rice in this rice cooker just to see how it turns out.  I will rinse it well first and keep an eye on it.  I hope it turns out well because I definitely like it more than the Jasmine rice.  I also like brown rice and plan to try it.  I love wild rice, too, but I am not sure if this rice cooker cooks wild rice.  Japanese must eat mainly sushi rice and brown rices because this rice cooker seems more geared to those rices than any others.I plan to make some steel cut oats later in the week.  I think they will turn out well, too, based on my experience today so far.  I love that I all I have to do is put the washed rice into the machine with the appropriate amount of water, set it, and walk off without having to remember to do anything else.  I have seen several YouTube videos where veggies and even some meats were added to the rice with great results, so I plan to try that soon, too.  One YouTube chef added a tomato and a splash of olive oil to his rice, and it turned out beautifully.  I bet it tasted good.  I want to try that as well.  My only concern is whether the acid in the tomato might not be good for the non-stick coating.  Manufacturer warns against using vinegar but does not mention tomatoes.The upshot is that my first batch of rice was easy to make and turned out fine.  I must try more rices and porridge in it as well, but if all goes well, and especially if I can get away with making parboiled, or even plain long grain rice in this cooker, I shall be happy.  I have no problems making consistently good rice on the stove top, but I have to watch my stove top rice and turn it off at the end cooking time, etc.  This rice cooker can free me up not to have stick close to the stove top.If you love rice and eat a lot of it, as do I, then this might be a good purchase for you.  If you only eat rice once per week or less, then you can probably stick with the stove top method and earmark the $200 for something else you want/need.As something of an aside, I found a couple of etsy sellers who custom make cozy covers for appliances and teapots, etc.  I probably will have a cozy made for this rice cooker as it will live its life on my countertop (no cupboard space available), and I want to keep it protected from dust, etc.Re the timer function, I have not tried it so far, and I probably will rarely need to use it, but it is a very nice feature to have.  For example, if you knew you were going to be away from home all day or all afternoon at least, then you could use the timer to have rice ready at 6 or 7 p.m. or whatever time you will be back home.  The timer would also be nice if you wanted your rice to start cooking say one hour before you arise from a nap or come in from working in the garden, etc.  Many reviewers lament the long cooking times, but really, the cooking times are not so long.  It takes 40 minutes to cook long grain parboiled rice on the stove top.  It did not take much longer to make Jasmine rice in this rice cooker.  Besides, you should plan ahead.  If I know I want to eat a meal at say noon, then I wash the rice and start it cooking up to two hours before I plan to eat.  The rice will be kept warm until I do eat.  The cooking time is only a hassle if one does not plan ahead.  There is a remedy for this, however, you can buy Minute Brand Instant Rice instead.Now, I have one HUGE complaint here, but it has nothing to do with the manufacturer or the rice cooker.  My complaint is again Amazon.  They shipped this $200 rice cooker to me in the manufacturer's box.  No shipping box was used.  Somewhere along the way, either they dropped it really hard or something big and sharp fell on it because there was a HUGE gash on one side of the box, and the box's corners were all smashed in.  Who in his right mind ships a $200 piece of computerised equipment without a shipping box?Then, to add insult to injury, the delivery person simply opened my gate and left the rice cooker sitting in the muddy wet grass (we had a lot of rain the day before, and it still was not dry out) even though there was a DRY, CLEAN sidewalk right next to where he left it.  Moreover, it was only a very few more feet to to walk to reach my garden bench beneath my covered porch where it not only could have been left in a dry area protected from rain and also further from the gate where someone could have spied it and reached inside to grab it.  This just shows a lack of attention and concern in the delivery.I have had to complain at least 4-5 times in the last few months about Amazon drivers leaving my packages OUTSIDE of my gate where they are very likely to be stolen.  I cannot wrap my head around how these drivers must think if they would leave packages outside of the gate or leave packages inside the gate but in the muddy grass even though the dry, safe porch is only a few more feet away.29 July 21 ETA:  I have now prepared Jasmine rice, steel cut oats, aka Irish oats, wild rice blend, and long grain parboiled rice in this machine, and they all turned out great.  The only one I was concerned about was the long grain parboiled rice, but I need not have worried.  I prepared 1 cup rice to 1.25 cups water and cooked it on Mixed, and it turned out just fine.  Be sure to wash you rice before cooking, though.  I forgot to wash the wild rice blend, and it turned out too sticky for wild rice.  I used the rice/water ratio of 1 cup rice to 1.5 cups water and used the brown rice setting per the Zojirushi website.  I thought the mixed rice setting is for rice with other items added, e.g. veggies, but I think the next time I will try the mixed rice setting because after all, I used a blend of black, brown, red, and wild rice.  It may turn out better on the mixed rice setting, and it should turn out better if I remember to rinse it of course.  This is an object in mindfulness.  If we let too many things distract us at once, then we cannot focus on a simple task well enough to do a proper job.  Making rice can be very Zen if you are in the moment.Conclusion: this rice cooker will cook most rices just fine including parboiled long grain rice, and I am now very happy indeed.  I really wish I would have purchased one of the Zojirushi rice cookers 2-3 ago at the time I first became interested in them.  Two things held me back.  Firstly, I thought the rice cooker would not be able to cook long grain parboiled rice which is my go-to rice, and secondly, I did not think I could add other ingredients to my rice, e.g. veggies.  I was wrong on BOTH counts.  If these are issues that have held you back, do not let them.  This rice cooker is quite versatile.For example, I made Jasmine rice in the cooker one day.  I added an whole, fresh tomato and a splash of olive oil to the pot. I saw a chef do this on YouTube.  It turned out great.  I added my usual Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix to my long grain parboiled rice, and it turned out great, too.  I will continue to experiment, but at this point, I think this rice cooker could cook pretty much any type of rice you care to put into it, and do not fear adding veggies and even some minced pieces of lean meat if you eat meat.Given the range of grains I can cook in this rice cooker and the ease of using and cleaning it, I am very pleased with this rice cooker.  I am less pleased with Amazon at the moment, though.  If you decide to purchase one, remember to stipulate that it be sent in Amazon packaging IF you care about the manufacturer box arriving in good shape.ETA:  Well, I have been using my rice cooker for over a year now!  I cannot believe I have had it that long already!  I still love it and use pretty much every single day.  I did want to add a caveat to my review, though.The instructions say to be sure to wipe off any moisture from the bottom of the cooking before you place it in the base and use it.  I never gave it much thought as to why, but I always wiped it, or so I thought.  It seems I used it a couple of time whilst there was still moisture on the outside bottom of the bowl, and that moisture sort of \"baked\" into the metal where you place the bowl.  I tried to unsuccessfully to scrub it out. It seems permanent.  I cannot budge it.  It appears to be cosmetic only, but it bothers me nonetheless.  I am happy that the rice cooker still performs just fine, but every time I remove the bowl and see those marks, it bothers me.  Once this rice cooker has to be replaced, next time I will be very, very careful to remove all moisture from the bottom of the bowl before I place it into the base to cook rice or anything else.  Attaching a photo for you so you can see what it looks like.  Wish I could figure out a way to clean off of these ugly, dark \"burns.\"  I am not really sure what to call them.  I guess it must be the minerals in the water that were baked on or burned into the metal?  If anyone knows how to remove these \"burns,\" please let the rest of us know."

The cheese separates to glue and oil.<br>They should have used a pulse width modulator and a logic circuit to throttle the heat source to maintain a constant output.<br>I don't know how it works for oil or chocolate, didn't try."

    "output": "Absolute crap and a fraud.: This thing is an absolute POS and a fraud.  The motor is NOT 1000 watts, it's a weak motor with an inertia flywheel.  God help you if you put a couple carrots or apples in.  The motor nearly slows to a halt.  Then you have to wait 20+ seconds or so for the feeble motor to gather enough speed before making another futile attempt at juicing.While we're talking about juicing, be forewarned, if all you ever want to juice is celery, kale, carrot, potatoes, and apple, then this is the juicer for you.It will NOT juice oranges, grapefruit, cherries, strawberries, blueberries, pomegranate, banana, mango, melon, raspberries, blackberries, lemon, lime, tangerine, etc....Yes, I am fully aware of the \"slow speed\" function on the \"juicer\" for \"soft fruit\".  All this does is grind up whatever it can and chucks it immediately in the pulp can.  ...that is until it gets down to the last 1/2\" or so, then it just takes the entire thing and chucks it in the pulp can.I bought this thing because I do not want a masticating juicer.  I wanted an efficient juicer that WORKED and was durable enough to stand up to many years of heavy use.  Holy hell was I WRONG!.  I am shocked the motor held out long enough to make the couple dozen \"glasses\" I did manage to coax out of it.  I seriously doubt the motor is strong enough to withstand the strain from the inertial flywheel for more than a month.  It's ALREADY audibly and significantly SLOWER than it was after the first 4 attempts.Clean up easy?  Not even close.  After you spend about an hour trying despirately to coax juice out of this POS using different prep cut lengths, different pressures, or even no pressure at all, you are THEN treated to about 20-25 minutes of clean up.  The lid to this thing is plastic, and entire chunks of fruit are launched at it at light speed, so naturally, it gets scratched, gouged, and roughed up.  Which you then have to scrub to get all the crap out of it, thus making even MORE scratches for bacteria, virus', and filth to hid in.  Good thing the advert said this was ALL STAINLESS STEEL!!!  Then you get to disassemble the entire thing, which is the ONLY decent thing about this POS.  Forget about the brush they give you.  All that is good for is spending 15-20 minutes scrubbing the crap out of the screen, both sides, twice, at LEAST, to get all the food off.  For everything else, you need a myriad of tools.  A custom bottle brush to clean the inside of the juice shute, another bottle brush with long bristles to clean up under the lip in the juice catch, then you still have to do some sponge kung-fu in order to attempt to get all the food out of all the tight, small, inside, 3 corner areas.  FUN!!!  EASY!!!Oh, I forgot to mention, then you have to clean the motor base where juice leaked all over it, and underneath it as well, where the juice leaks all over the side of itself.  I mean, unless you want to pick it up, tilt it, and try and shake all the juice out while the catch can is still there.  It's still going to drip all over itself and it's going to run underneath and into the treaded rubber feet.I don't know what I'll do for a juicer now.  I guess I have to buy a real commercial one.  Because apparently, this one is NOT!  Even according to Breville's website.  I guess the big \"COMMERCIAL\" sticker on the side of this thing is sarcasm.  Not fraud.  Oh, no.  Never.For now, I will just have to fight the urge to smash this thing through the skull of anyone with the misfortune of having an Australian accent and raiding his pockets for my $300."

It does not come with a lid; it will simmer much quicker with a lid.<br><br>2.) It would be so much better if the pot could be detached from the base where the electric plug is for easier and safer cleaning. Now I would need to be very careful not to submerge it in water and not let any water go in the plug as I wash the pot.

It has gotten to the point where I need to spray a little cooking spray on the plates, but it still cooks evenly and the waffles come out great. Since the plates come off the unit, it is very easy to use a soft brush to clean the plates. If these newer models are made close to the older ones, they are definitely worth having one on hand."

So it’s enough for two of us to eat without waiting.Why 4 stars, not 5? There are two things I would change. 1. I wish the power cable is longer as we use it on the table. 2.

It makes 11 cups of cooked rice.The 5.5 cup volume is a little misleading for us Indians. We normally cook rice, rice:water = 1:2 ratio. So basically this rice cooker cooks a max of 3 3/4 cups of rice (using the cup provided).You will be astonished at the difference in taste between the rice cooked here versus some other cooker. I'm not exaggerating as I've two different rice cookers, the other one being Sanyo.I love the fuzzy logic feature where you can cook different rices & porridge's. The delayed time setting is a blessing... when I bought it at the end of 2005, nobody else had the delayed time setting. Obviously there are newer models now.For a family of 4 (2 kids below ages of 8yrs), this is just the perfect size!"

That led me to our current one - We ALWAYS have a pot of rice ready to eat, and lately its been getting hard again - the internal pot isn't damaged - I finally figured out the lid just won't seal completely!  I'm frustrated.  I LOVE this rice cooker - so much so i've bought one for several family members and friends!  Guess i should have gotten the extended warranty!"

Carrots and hard veggies, if cut, does a great job but it is a pain in the but to pre-cut everything. But I do it so it's easier on the machine.Even though it doesn't juice fruit well, it makes great sorbets! Just add frozen fruit. So easy. Cleaning is also easy, just rinse everything or throw it in the dish washer like I do. Overall, I don't have much complaints except the preparation. Bu I bought this machine because it was cheaper than the other style juicers, and reliable and slow enough not to damage the live enzymes. My juicer also came with a 10 year warranty so that's good."

    "output": "Perfect rice every time!: I use this rice cooker almost every day. It is so simple that not even a monkey could mess it up. Add the desired amount of rice, fill water to line, press button down, then wait for rice to finish cooking.Pros:Simplicity: 5/5You literally just need to push the button down and it makes you your rice and it is cooked to perfection every time.Durability: 5/5Has held up well over the test of time. It’s a very simple device so I expect it to last for years to come. It reminds me of old appliances that used to be unbreakable and lasted forever.Cleaning: 5/5The lid and rice container are the only things that get dirty and they are easily detached from the heating element and extremely easy to clean. I’m pretty sure the rice container is nonstick and cleans like a dream. The lid is glass and is also very easy to clean by hand. Both are machine washable and come out sparkling if you want to do it that way, but it takes less than 2 minutes to clean by hand so I usually just do that.Cons:Messy: 4/5It’s honestly not that messy, but there is a steam release hole on the lid which releases steam. The steam can contain some starches and leaves a small film on the lid and if the steam vent is close to something like a cabinet or a wall it will get a small starchy film on it. Easily wipes clean with just water and doesn’t stain at all though.TLDR: this is an amazing product and if you make rice a lot it will work very well for you. Zojirushi is a gold standard for a reason. You can get fancier models that do extra stuff, but if you just want to cook rice then look no further.I highly recommend this rice cooker!"

After a Year: It was great in the beginning, but even with attentive care and cleaning within a matter of months it is useless and dangerous.1) the nonstick fails quickly2) the heat distribution is so uneven that only the center of the griddle is usable.3) the clips that hold the plates in loosen quickly, so now they're trying to slide from side to side as you're cooking because they don't sit flush (as a other reviewer demonstrated).So allow me to put these things together to demonstrate the devastation. Upon opening, the waffle batter you just made presents like a feral dog with peanut butter in it's jaws- it's now burnt in some places, wet in others, and your waffles are simultaneously dripping and burning to both grill plates. So you begin to scrape as much off as you can, but when you touch it with the spatula, the grill plate shifts above the handle and you burn your knuckles. You fight with it for another 5 min while you wait for wet spots to cook a bit more, burnt spots to burn further so they can actually be scraped off, and now your house is filled with that awful smell of failure. You limp the process along by making a lopsided waffle in the center of the grill plates, but still need to pray to several Gods to squeak 2 waffles out unharmed."

Having rice only for dinner used to be a struggle meal. But now I happily eat a bowl of rice with soy sauce as a small dinner or snack.The rice comes out perfectly consistent every time, neither too firm nor too sticky.

I purchased the square trade 3 year warranty, just in case, as it did not cost much (about $30 bucks) and gives added peace of mind.  Came in the original box, no scratches, etc.  It's pretty perfect. It's big, so you need a place for it, but it's beautiful, so I'm ok with leaving it out. There are a bunch of parts, but nothing unreasonable.  Soak the mesh filter just a couple of minutes and use the included brush or buy a cheap one elsewhere to clean the screen. Mine came with two (!) though I find my cheap little Ikea (2 for 99 cents) kitchen brush works just as well.  One piece of advise: Use WARM WATER to clean the plastic parts (including the pitcher).  I read some reviews that say those parts get \"cloudy\" or murky-looking over time; hot water will do that to plastic.  Use warm water and it should stay looking good much longer.  Happy juicing!"

I chop my onions with a knife and a cutting board which are even easier to clean than this is and about as fast. Very easy to clean. They say best not in dishwasher but I just pull the lid, etc. off there and put them in the dishwasher (top rack only) yet no damage showed up for 10 years.

I decided to do this after hearing my wife complain again that she can never get rice to turn out right on the stove.I'm a practical shopper, so I first looked at basic cookers, then got into the fuzzy logic ones. I decided on the Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5 1/2 cup because it had all the advantages of making perfect rice and if it did, which it does, would be a good buy with no regrets. There are more expensive ones that have induction heat, but my real goal was just to have great rice.If I had to do it all over again, I may look more closely at the Tiger sold at Costco for less money, however I'm really happy with what I got.So far I've made 3 batches of white rice, one of brown, and one batch of oatmeal.  Everything came out perfect.  I really like the keep warm feature, you can go for several hours.  The lid pops open when you push the button and has a nice seal that keeps the moisture in. The retractable cord seems overkill for a tabletop appliance, but it is convenient, you can retract the cord and take it to the table if you want.  Cleans up easy, nice non-stick surface on the bowl and the lid has an insert that comes apart easily.The directions explain about rice type and the different settings available. To an amature rice consumer, it's pretty confusing, but it comes down to just using 1 of the two measuring cups provided, filling to the correct line with water, then selecting a program.It makes plenty of rice for our family of 4 with leftovers."

As a result, if bumped or touched during use, it could detach and cause the multi-cooker to stop heating. Avoid contact with the magnetic cord during operation.\"I would amend that to \"...WILL detach and cause the multi-cooker to stop heating.\"I checked the old Dazey DTC-1 Probe... but Presto very carefully designed the heater connections at a different span diameter; so that you can't use the old Probe to replace the Junk version.I will be purchasing a \"Presto 6900 Electric Griddle Heat Control\" to replace this useless dreck.The specs appear identical to the new Control...without the \"safety\" feature.You have been warned; Good Luck."

There is no inconvenience to plugging it in and then unplugging it to turn it off. If it had an on/off switch, that would just be more steps to complete. I agree that the butter melter does get very hot but it cools off quickly so it's easy to pickup in seconds. Perhaps the clear plastic top does have a chance of warping out of shape, but if you leave it on and wait for it to cool down before you clean it, it should keep its shape. All kernels are ejected into the serving bowl but about 2 dozen remain unpopped.  I consider that to be a problem of the popcorn brand, not the machine."

It is so easy to use, easy to clean and stores nicely!  I researched a lot before buying this fondue pot and I can say that its the best fondue pot out there.  I have actually bought 3 of this fondue pot.  My hubby and I loved it soo much that we bought it for a friends wedding who decided to have fondue for their reception.  Everyone was asking where we bought, how much it was and saying how quick and easy it was to use! I think we made some sales that day!  LOL..I have 2 at home since we usually do a 3 course fondue night dinner.. The clean up on the pots is soo fast, just a little soap and a quick wipe gets rid of everything which means no scrubbing between courses!!  The pot heats up amazingly fast!!  I think it took less than 2 min. to heat up a FULL pot of Coq Au Vin sauce for cooking our meats/seafood.  Infact it was soo fast that I didn't have time to do all my preparation I ususally do when I have to wait for the sterno to heat up my old fondue pot and had to have help.I love the fact that the pot has a wide mouth to it.  It allows many fondue forks to be able to be sitting in the pot at once. I think we had 5 people in one pot at the wedding which is a lot considering each person had 2 forks in the pot at once.  The temperature control is fantastic!! With so many sticks in the pot, we just turned up the temperature a little and there was no waiting to cook the food because the temperature had dropped, then you have to wait for it to heat up again.I no longer have burnt Cheese fondue because I couldn't control the heat on my sterno fondue pots.  I like the fact that I have a good temperature on my chocolate and it doesn't sear half of your tastebuds off because its just too hot.Oh, and I didn't mention... you can put it in the dishwasher!!!!!  SOO easy.  I like to wash by hand but the hubby is all about the dishwasher cleaning it.  Not that it matters because everything comes off of the inside soooo easily.The only disappointment I had was the short cord, but it really wasn't a big deal since we just plugged it into an extension cord.Overall I would totally recommend this pot to someone who is wanting a great fondue pot, or someone who is scared to take the plunge for an electric fondue pot.. TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY!!!"

    "output": "Great for people who like many rice varieties: I just bought this older model in 2019.  It seems very successful because it's been manufactured for a long time, and still it is listed as a \"current\" model on Zojirushi's website. I don't regret the purchase because it is probably best for me in the 1 liter (5.5 cup) range (same for 1.8 L), but as I note below, it has some downsides that made me a little disappointed.  I was interested in the spherical heating element, the handles on the inner bowl, the extended keep-warm function, the retractable power cord, and the many varieties of rice settings. I would recommend something cheaper and/or newer if you mostly want to use it for white rice. But if you like a variety of rices, including different degrees of \"brown-ness\" and hardness then this is really one of the best in this price range, I think. That's probably why the model has stuck around for so long.  BUT, the newer models have a \"steam\" function which this does NOT. So, the current description on Amazon's page for the item is WRONG. A similar, newer \"Made in Japan\" model for roughly same price (with removable cord, and fewer rice varieties, and newer steam vent design) does have \"Steam\" function and the description for the two is incorrectly duplicated here. I am still glad I got this one.I have a 3 cup Zojirushi, the NS-LAC05 that I bought about 10 years ago, which is very similar to the current NS-LGC05 and NS-LHC05, and I wanted a bigger one. My 3-cup cooker is made in China like most Zojirushi models, and if you want this \"Neuro-Fuzzy\" because it is \"Japanese,\" then in my experience that's a bad reason to choose a Zojirushi model. (Incidentally, my old cooker also had \"Neuro-Fuzzy written on the manual cover, so that is not a tech unique to this model.)  They are all Japanese (just like iPhone is not a \"Chinese\" phone, just expertly assembled there -- so to that extent, yes it is Chinese). You just pay extra for the \"Made in Japan\" prominently printed on front, for no good reason. Or rather, a very bad reason, because my older cooker seems like more high-quality construction.  This one is in some ways less thoughtfully made, to make up for the more expensive cost of labor, is my guess. For example, when you open the door, you can see exposed screws, and exposed inside of the plastic part of the lid, which does not look nice. The Chinese-made models have an extra piece of plastic to cover up the screws and makes the inside look nice. I care about aesthetics and details like that.  And I like to leave the lid open much of the time, with inner lid gently placed on the bowl, when the cooker is not in use because it seems better for the gaskets, plus it airs things out. But this model looks too unpleasant that way so I will probably keep it closed.  (Not sure whether open or closed is best for the gasket, or if it matters.) Also, my 3-cup model has nice metal parts on the outside, and this one is all plastic, although nice smooth high-quality plastic. And the lid-opening button is nicer and possibly sturdier on the Chinese-made models. But the thing I like the most about my 3-cup one over this model is the steam vent. I think it is an advancement over this older model. It has an upper compartment to collect the extra moisture, so there is an additional cover-piece and gasket on top. And it is easier to wipe the steam vent clean in the inside of the lid for the newer design. Again, more fancy construction with more parts, which may be why the more simple design of the NS-ZCC models is still cost-effective to manufacture in Japan.  And the better-constructed lids are almost certainly more resistant to warping from heat.One important thing to note about this model is that it was designed for the Japanese market, where \"regular\" rice is short or medium grain, not the long-grain I'm used to. I often buy nice quality organic Jasmine or Basmati. On my old cooker, there was a \"white/mixed\" setting and a separate \"sushi\" setting, whereas on this one there is \"regular/sushi\" and a separate \"mixed.\"  I think my long grain rice cooks better with the \"mixed\" setting rather than \"regular\" on this model.  The first time I cooked it with regular setting, it was really disgusting mush, so I tried the \"mixed\" and then it was nice. But I also took care to rinse the rice super well (at least 4 times rather than 3 like last time) so that may have helped, too. And I used water up to the mark rather than a bit extra (the manual says to use extra water with long grain but says nothing about proper menu selection). The \"mixed\" setting does not get as hot, to keep it from boiling over. So anyway, this may explain the mixed reviews for this product, with many people loving it and some people having very bad experience.  \"Regular\" in Japan is not really \"regular\" in most places, because most places tend to use long-grained rice. One downside of using the \"mixed\" instead of \"white/sushi\" setting is that extended keep warm is not settable for \"mixed\" since they want you to keep only white rice for extended time in it. But I don't keep rice for more than ~10 hours and the regular \"keep warm\" was fine for me for several hours. [UPDATE: The mush on my first try was my fault; the rice I used just needs to be rinsed really well because it has lots of starch. When I rinse really well, it turns out excellent on the \"Regular\" setting also. And American Long Grain did not have this issue. So it is not a cooker problem at all, and long-grain rice can be cooked on regular setting and used with extended keep-warm.]Two bad things about the Zojirushi models, probably all of them: 1) the irreplaceable battery, which means after a few years you will need to keep it plugged in if you don't want to reset the clock. Yes, you can ship it in for servicing but that's very expensive just for the battery and I did not (and will not) do it for my 3-cup model. One reviewer wrote (I forget for which model) that this is consumer-hostile and I absolutely agree. What kind of clock (or watch) do you have to send in to the manufacturer to replace the battery? It is outrageous and inconsiderate. I might figure out how to solder in a replacement battery myself, before I would spend so much money (and be without my cooker) for replacing.  2) The second bad thing is the super expensive replacement bowls and other parts. All non-stick surfaces will eventually wear out, and Zojirushi replacement is ~$50-70 for the bowls. You can buy a normal (non-fuzzy) rice cooker for under $20! And many nice fancier than bare-bones cookers for under the price of a replacement bowl (the bowls are very nice, though, and high quality).  An inner lid replacement (which you may need if the gasket is damaged) is ~$22-28. The tiny spatula holder, which seems like it is worth under a dollar, is nearly $5, though to be fair, all prices on their site include shipping. Plus at least you have the option to order replacements. The spatula holder is not easily removable without damage (because it has plastic hooks that allow it to slide in one direction) and I broke mine when I yanked it out for cleaning. But not worth the cost of replacement. How do the parts prices compare to those for, say, Instant Pot? And expensive cooking equipment really should have replacement parts available for parts that wear out. I would not buy from a company that did not offer that. But the prices are totally unreasonable for the Zoji parts. So as with the battery, this is very consumer-hostile and for this reason I seriously considered shopping for another brand. But the cooker is excellent otherwise, so I stuck with this brand.One last note about the non-stick surface: the important thing for protecting it is not so much the material that comes in contact with it but the smoothness of it. A non-smooth metal utensil is more likely to cause damage than a non-smooth plastic one, but plastic utensils can cause damage, too. The plastic spatula that came with my 3-cup model was not very smooth and that's why my 3-cup bowl got damaged, since I never used other utensils inside the bowl. The new spatula that came with this ZCC model looks almost identical but is slightly softer plastic and also very smooth. So, feel the edge of the utensil that you use inside the bowl, and don't use it if it does not feel smooth, even if it is plastic. And in any case be super gentle even with any plastic or wooden utensil. As far as toxicity, the Teflon coatings manufactured since 2013 should all be safe (and probably most manufacturers phased out the questionable type coating long before then). If you do research from reputable sources on this topic, I think you'll find that there is no evidence that the very inert material in these coatings is harmful. Almost everything is toxic in large-enough quantities, and you are not consuming gobs of coating. So that's something to keep in mind when considering whether or not to replace an old Zoji bowl."

    "output": "Great juicer...3 yrs later still a great juicer: (FOLLOW UP REVIEW APRIL 2012)I've owned this juicer for nearly 3 yrs and used it almost daily since i first bought it.  All i can say is that I'm surprised that i don't have a single shred of buyers remorse with this purchase and i usually do with almost everything that I buy. It works the same today as the first day which i find to be rare with appliances these days.  Since 3 years ago, i've continued my research in juicers and i periodically check if there is a better one out there.  There are tons of juicer comparison videos online and I encourage all of you to watch them before making your purchase decision.  What i've learned in the past 3 years is that there are 4 main types of juicers: centrifugal, single auger, twin gear, and hydraulic press.  If your top priority is maximum juice quality and yield for the broadest scope of fruits and vegetables then you can ignore centrifugal type juicers...in my opinion.  When comparing single auger, twin gear and hydraulic press type juicers i find that the difference in juice quality and yield is small.  I've thought long and hard about upgrading to a twin gear and even a hydraulic press type juicer over the past 3 yrs but i just can't justify spending the extra $500-$2500 (Greenstar to Norwalk) for negligible increase in quality and yield.  If money and preparation time was of no concern of mine i might feel differently.  In summary, if your top priority is quality and yield then you get the biggest bang for your buck with a low rpm single auger type juicer like the omega 8003-8006.Cons:1. One thing the the omega 8003 doesn't do well is making nut milks like almond milk or soy milk.  I don't ever make those so it's not an issue with me but if it is perhaps a vertical single auger juicer like the omega vrt, kurvings silent juicer or Hurom vertical juicer is right for you.  (I would be cautious with the kurvings and Hurom brands because they haven't been around as long so they might not be around to honor the warranty.)2. A common complaint is that the feed tube is small which requires the user to slice up the produce more than they would have to if using another style juicer.  I agree that the in an ideal world the feed tube would be larger but my concern there would be that a larger feed tube would put larger chunks of produce through the machine possibly requiring a more powerful and more expensive motor.  The small diameter feed tube doesn't necessarily require more prep time...it depends on what you are juicing.  When juicing carrots, i find that baby carrots require no prep and provide the same yield as regular carrots.  Kale, chard, celery, collard greens, etc...will fit right in the machine without any cutting.  So I find that the small inlet diameter isn't a big deal to me but just know that some people complain about it.If you're interested in buying this juicer, just know that omega has updated this design and implemented the improvements in the 8004 (white) and 8006 (chrome) models.  They've updated the material of the auger to GE Ultem which is a plastic that is 8 times harder than the 8003's melamine auger.  They've also improved the juicer cone design to improve it's strength and added 5 more yrs to the products warranty (15 yr total!).  Less significant design changes are the design of the collection cups and shell of the motor.  These updates are significant enough that if i were to purchase a juicer now i would get the 8004 with the extended warranty, updated juicer cone design and harder auger.My goal in this review is to help the reader avoid making the same trial and error mistakes that i did with buying and ultimately returning different juicers until i finally bought this one.  let my review here be a testament to how satisfied I am with this juicer.  People are more likely to write a review of a product that they've had nothing but trouble with.  I takes an extremely satisfied customer to take the time to write an honest review.  So if I sound like I'm over selling this juicer it's only because i'm extremely proud of this purchase.I wish you all the best in your juicing endeavors and if you have any questions please post a comment as I love sharing my knowledge and passion for healthy living.(ORIGINAL REVIEW SEPT 2009)I wanted to get into juicing so I started researching juicers on Amazon.  I originally bought the Breville BJE200XL.  This juicer is very popular on this site and received good reviews.  I beg to differ.  It was cumbersome, difficult to clean, and the juice didn't taste very good.  I immediately returned this juicer and did more research.  In my opinion, if you're serious about juicing I would highly recommend the Omega 8003.  It's quiet, easy to clean, and produces great tasting, high quality juice.  It's worth every penny and i'll never make the mistake of buying a centrifugal juicer again."

With its powerful extraction, this juicer effortlessly turns even the toughest fruits and vegetables into a delicious and nutritious drink. It's like having a professional juicer right in my own kitchen! The compact design is also a major plus, as it doesn't take up much counter space. However, if there's one area that could be improved, it's the durability. While the juicer has performed admirably so far, I can't help but wonder if it will stand the test of time. But overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase and look forward to many more glasses of refreshing juice with Breville's Juice Fountain Compact Juicer."

Higher quality models have stronger auger and bigger feed tube. They are also 100 to 200 dollars more. I have had no issues as of yet with the auger being not hard enough. Just remember to cycle soft and hard produce and the machine should operate fine and not get backed up.The only drawback is that the feed tube could be a little wider. Then I wouldn't have to quarter my cucumbers, would be able to fit in more leafy greens at a time etc. If you want a bigger feed tube, then you should look into the Omega NC800, but I personally couldn't justify spending the extra 100 bucks.

It's not a powerhouse, so blending ice cream can take a little more time and effort, but it does the job. The blending disc is plastic, so I'm sure it will not last to long, but for how often we use it (and for the price) I don't think that will be any time soon. Overall, I would say for the money it does the job."

I decided that it was time less storage space and a more compact size.  This little guy is great.  Nicely cooked rice - always.  Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store.  At first I was concerned that it didn’t have a “keep warm” mode, but I quickly learned that once the rice was cooked, it stayed warm at least as long as I kept the lid closed.  Easy, easy, easy.  Highly recommend!"

The juice used to be smoother, but now I have to strain it for us to drink it. For someone who juices twice a day, it's extremely disappointing, not to say time-consuming.Juicing takes time, from buying the ingredients, washing and cutting them, and cleaning the juicer!

Opened the box and was very pleased with the obvious quality of the cooker.  The next morning I decided to cook some oatmeal in it.  Added rolled oats, water, little salt and butter and turned it on and let it cook while I went out for my morning walk.  After my shower opened rice cooker - oatmeal was hot and perfectly cooked.  And clean up was a breeze.  The leftover oatmeal slide out of the bowl.  The next night I cooked Jasmine rice in it. It was cooked perfectly.  I am going to try to make rice pudding in it tonight.  Things I love about this cooker are its size, quality, non-stick bowl and rice paddle and how easy it is to use.  Makes plenty of rice, even for a family. Amazon has the best price I could find.

Still stuck.The frame is thinner than your parent's waffle maker, obviously done to cut costs, but what it results in is a frame that warps and puts pressure on the plates to pop out. The temperature regulator device is too tall for the container putting upward pressure on the plate. Combine this with cheap latches and the bottom plate will pull up every time with the waffle. It doesn't stay that way as the waffle will tear apart and the plate will then fall. Don't worry, I caught it with my bare hands.  This issue would've been caught is they had done any level of product testing. I'm sure they did and addressed it placing profit over safety. It feels intentional. This is getting thrown out and I'm definitely reading Black and Decker reviews in the future before buying.Do not buy this product if you want waffles or a safe experience.

I've had a Champion=== top of the line--terrible noise & didn't do a good job with leafy greens, forget wheat grass, got strangled with celery (In middle of juicing, I would have to dismantle the Champion to clean out celery \"hair\" so Champion could continue to function rather than heat up more-- & heating up is a big problem with Champions, per my experience & that of niece, who's a raw chef & our friends)  I've also had a Krups and several other off brands.  For me, the Omega 8003 (or 8005) is built like a Buick-- meant to last.  Yes, you do have to chop up food more than with a Champion, but I'm happy to do this for the results.  My niece, the raw chef, who thought she'd enjoy cutting up less, especially during one of her classes at Whole Foods, bought a Hurom.  She didn't like it...she sold it & went back to her Omega 8003."

    "output": "Must have.: If you are a Pizza lover or have children, then this is a must have. I have owned one for at least the last 12-15 years. I have 4 sons who absolutely love pizza and use this all the time to reheat their Pizza. 3 of my sons have moved out and this is the first appliance that I buy for them and they love it. I actually use it on fresh bought  pizza to make it crispy. I grew up in NY, worked in Manhattan and had pizza all the time. I like to be able to fold my pizza and have it stand up by itself, however that is rarely found in Florida. Whenever I order pizza I ask to have it done crispy but it is still a little weak. So as soon as I bring the Pizza home, I immediately put it on the Pizzazz and set it to the lower setting and it makes the crust crispy, just the way I like it and it works perfectly. The Pizzazz has 3 settings on it, upper lower and both. This way if you want you can heat up just the bottom or top.The second thing that I love about the Pizzazz is the fact that it has a timer. You can set the type of heat you want top, bottom or both and then set the timer. This works great with kids  (especially teenagers), where they place a piece of pizza on it and walk away. Then return hours later to eat it. My sons used to turn the oven on, put the pizza in and forget about. Now the pizza is burnt and the oven has been on for hours. Basically it will save you money in electricity and pay for itself, and possibly save your house from burning down. Also if you live in Florida like me, the last thing you want to do in the summer is turn the oven on because it heats up the whole house, especially if its on for hours.The last thing is you don't have to use it for just cooking pizza. I use it to heat up plenty of other foods. Like a left over chicken parm sandwich (it makes the bread nice and crispy), tatter tots,  or even make garlic bread. To make garlic bread, cut some Italian bread in half, put some butter on it and sprinkle some garlic powder. Place it on the Pizzazz set the timer and your done."

We got one 35 years ago as a gift and it finally gave out this year because one of the cones cracked.  I have picked up a half dozen of them in the thrift shops through the years. I have one in the motor home and given some to the adult children.  I have had no problem with solid things.  It is not designed for onions.  a hand chopper or small food processor is great for onions. I do it all with a sharp knife in seconds.  Very soft cheese would never work even on a hand grater.  If you can't grate it on a hand grater the machine will not do it.  Onions are slime and they will not work.  I use it for shredding cheese, potato's all the time.  I can shop carrots so fast that it does not pay to get out the shooter.  If you want fancy cuts it is great.  I can use knives very well and keep them razor sharp.  I would never be without one.  I use it several times a week.  It is one of the few kitchen gadgets that I would not be without.  I read all the bad reviews.  They were a hoot.  Not so bright club.  They don't melt in the dishwasher unless you let them slip to the bottom and touch the heating element.  After 35 years of being cleaned in the dish washer I have never had any kind of problem.  For all the things people can't get it to do learn to use a knife but I am not sure you will be safe.  LOL"

I don’t think you have to keep reapplying it for every waffle. I really love mine and I think you will enjoy it too, at such a really good price.

If it had proper handles I might overlook this but it just has a thin piece of plastic on the lid, that also gets warm during cooking by the way giving it a melting plastic smell.Plates are only held on by a single thin metal clip that warps in the heat and results in the plates always falling off.I saw reviews for this on websites recommending this as a good low/mid price range waffle maker and I have other black & decker kitchen appliances that I love. I will be immediately asking for a refund, if this was $15-$25 I might excuse the cheap design but at $60+ it's a rip off."

It takes minutes to prepare a healthy and vitamin packed beverage and I love that I have total control over what I am consuming.  I would not ordinarily eat celery and do not much care for pears, but it's amazing how wonderful those things taste when they are juiced.  I was amazed at how sweet and refreshing a beverage I can get from juicing.  I have used the pulp to thicken vegetable soup and also I removed the pulp before juicing anything else and added that to my carrot muffins - delicious!We have found the 'trick' is to clean the machine immediately after use - and it takes less than five minutes to do so.  We don't bother lining the pump container either.  We hand wash all the components and let air dry.  The machine lives up to its reputation and was well worth the investment."

There is a lot of plastic where my food goes that I wish I could wash. If the company is reading this, please make a BPA-free version! I will pay more for it if I have to, this product is that good.- It's surprisingly dangerous so make sure you follow directions. Boiling hot kernels can go flying if you're not careful. My husband burned himself by stepping on one that had fallen on the floor without us knowing. They are hot and I mean hot.- Kernels do jump out into the bowl, but you can dump them back in if you do it quickly before it starts popping.Overall a great buy and would buy it again in a heartbeat.

I air dry and store the grinding plates in a bag of rice as another reviewer suggested, preventing the need to oil and avoiding the guminess that can be caused with prolonged storage.The noise of the motor that some felt was excessive is to me what would be expected from a grinder, it can't do the job and purr like a kitten!The unit is well made, sturdy, attractive, and gets the job done with ease. No problems with jams or speed and the finished product is a beautiful thing! I also suggest running bread or crackers through to purge the remains from the meat.Ground beef is my primary use for this machine and after extensive Internet searches for the best cuts to use, I have found that a combination of chuck and sirloin renders the best flavor, texture, and fat content. I trim any silver skin and grizzle from the meat, cube and chill, and run it first through the course grind, then the medium. When sirloin steaks are on sale (typically $2.98 lb. at the local Wegmans) I will ask the butcher for the whole cryovaced piece and purchase an equal amount of chuck at around $2.49 lb. This makes the price of top quality, safe and delicious ground beef comparable to the regular priced store-bought. I have found that the texture tends to be softer when using whole cuts rather than trimings so resist the temptation to grind more than twice."

It was compact, so it would be easy to store, and it was completely immersable so it would be easy to clean. It turned out to be just what I was looking for. I love how I can easily store it in my kitchen cabinets. I also love how I can just put in the sink to clean it.

My neighbor also have this same one for over a year, and loves it! Hope this helps, and you get to enjoy this as much as i do!

I timed it, and 1 cup of rice (using their measuring cup) cooked in just 19.5 minutes. I'm a very spontaneous meal-maker, so not having to wait for my rice to finish cooking every time I made a stir fry has been really nice. 20 minutes is just enough time to start making rice, then prep ingredients and cook for faster recipes, or to start making rice as soon as I start cooking for others.However, the first time I used it, it spewed rice water everywhere. I had to put a kitchen towel on top of it to prevent it from making a huge mess. After reading the reviews, I realized I needed to wash the rice a lot better. My old rice cooker was way more lenient about this, but here you need to wash and drain the rice 4-5 times until the water runs almost clear-- see picture attached. That solved my rice water spraying problems entirely!It's also pretty small, which is great for saving on counter space. Only negative is that there's no holder for the rice spatula, so I just keep that in my drawers."

Not everyone likes a thin waffle, but these waffles are the perfect size for me. The size reminds me of the Waffle House waffles that I love, but it was time for me to begin making my own.This waffle maker gets really hot, and the waffles turn out nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I like my batter to be the consistency of cake batter (not thick). I pour my batter using a 6 oz styrofoam cup.  I did use pancake mix for these waffles, just follow the instructions for making waffles. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1.5 tbsp of nonfat dry buttermilk to the mix. The waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I did use a little heavy cream to get a soft inside texture.  If you like to make and freeze waffles, I suggest you use a low setting so that your waffles don't get too dark. If the waffles are too dark and you place them in the toaster after freezing, they will darken even more and burn. I know some reviewers have mentioned the dial being too loose. It does feel loose, but it works, for now, anyway. If there are any changes, I will update my review. I suggest that you clean your waffle maker with a damp dish towel before using for the first time."

If I toss it in, depressing the lever leaves the bread hanging with the risen top sticking out. I need to push it down, but can only do it when the toasting elements are already heating, and I am using store bought oatnut bread.I was actually willing to deal with that, but in less than 8 months of light use, one slider started passing out of the slide track at the bottom and getting stuck, so it wouldn't pop up when toasting was complete. I was able to yank up on it for a while, but eventually that stopped working so I disassembled it to see if it could be bent back into shape. It worked a few times, then continued getting stuck. Sometimes the heating element would stay engaged and start to burn the item.I gave up on that side and we were fine but now the other side started doing it to, so I am shopping again. I can't believe the price of this given the quality. I hate throwing cheap stuff in the landfill, so I shoot for durable items in a slightly higher price range so it can at least be repaired if it breaks.I can attest to the crumb tray not working as well.

I had experienced the rice from this machine at a friend's house, about 5 years a go, and was instantly jealous of this cooker, but of course, I had to wait until I could get a better deal. People: you will not be disappointed or regret a single dollar that you throw at this machine.1) It is easy, almost fool proof. Measure the rice, rinse, fill water to the appropriate line, put the pot in, close the lid, find your setting,  hit \"cook.\"2) Rice cooks perfectly all by itself, adjusting within the cooker for the perfect time and texture. The neuro fuzzy plays a little tune when done, but worried you'll miss it?3) Don't be worried! The cooker automatically changes to \"Keep Warm\" mode. If you forget about your rice, it will be soft, fluffy and delicious for you, for up to 12 hours!3.5) Fluffy and delicious? Oh boy, yes. Seriously, tastes like the wonderful rice you get at any take-out restaurant. I used Calrose rice and it made fluffy, separate grains that also would stick together if pressed. I can't wait to experiment with Jasmine and Brown rices.4) If you're like me, if clean-up is a hassle, you'll think twice before using an appliance again. I lifted out the pot, filled with hot water, swished it around, and wiped it out with a paper towel. That was it. No more mess, no harsh chemicals needed, no effort. Clean as a whistle.I am in LOVE."

It takes the guess work out of all kinds of rice. We can eat brown jasmine, basmati, sticky, and about anything else you can imagine.When it arrived I was a tad overwhelmed by all the buttons and manual is a little hard to read. It took a little time and it's actually super easy to use. I'd say the directions are the hardest part! You have a little white scoop, you fill it with rice, fill the removable bowl with water/broth and adjust the cooker to the type of rice you are making. It sings a little song and makes the rice. Caveat- it can take a LONG time. Brown rice, especially. And, since it's using all that fuzzy logic stuff it has no idea when it's going to finish. I have gotten good at estimating and you will have to as well. I've gotten bold and I add broths, and savory herbs, onions, garlic, and other goodies to make pilafs. The Zojirushi manages to turn out a delicious pot of rice no matter what I put in there.Super super super easy to clean!The feature that allows you to put it all in in advance is excellent as well.Love it. Use it several times a week since we bought it almost a year ago. Worth every penny."

With the Orville Redenbacher's Hot Air Popper, I have never had a burnt kernel.  The lid at the top is for measuring out the kernels (including telling you the max amount), but it can also be used to warm the butter (I don't use butter or toppings).  The machine turns the kernels into popcorn very quickly, in a manner that is entertaining to the kids (...and I find it fun too).  The popcorn can be enjoyed warm, directly after making, or put it in some zip-lock bags for later use at room temperature.  The kids, my husband, and I all find this to be an enjoyable, healthy, and super-fast-to-prepare snack.  Our machine seems sturdy and well made.  Hope you enjoy this machine as much as we have been!"

I am very uncertain about the quality and its ability to stand the test of time.  I suppose time will tell.Also, as an important note, I have found Black and Decker products to be of excellent quality and reliable especially their outdoor products, so I am surprised about this product."

I have found that you should rinse the rice a little before starting the cooker up or it will bubble over the side a little leaving a sticky residue to clean up. My son uses this as much as I do and will be getting one for himself when he heads off to college!"

After juicing, dump a quart of water in with the pulp, swish around, then rinse the pulp into your compost bin.

As a result it takes a long time to heat and a long time to cook.You'll need hot pads to hold the lower plate down while opening the waffle iron.Thankfully the upper plate stays clipped into place, although it also moves quite a bit.The instructions advise 3-5 minutes to bake a waffle, I found 8-9 minutes were required.  Not so good if you are tying to make a bunch of waffles for a group.The plates are very light and don't retain much heat, so the heating element is on most of the time.

    "output": "New or old to juicing, this is the one!!: We bought this juicer over a year ago, fired up by watching \"Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead\" (which applied to us!). We have been juicing with it 4-5 times a week ever since, and recently had a chance to spend a weekend with a friend who bought the Omega juicer instead, lured by the promise of better extraction and dryer pulp.<br><br>I am here to tell you the Breville wins hands down. The Omegas are fine machines, but you must cut everything up in teensy pieces, it takes forever (forever!) to process the bits, and some things get stuck easily ie. kale or celery when not perfectly crisp. The Omega process takes forever.<br><br>The Breville is super fast...first because the wide feed chute means you can feed in whole carrots, zucchini and cukes, and it tears through ginger root, halved apples, oranges, beets, and bunches of greens. Most mornings I get up and quickly do the day's 2 L (2 quarts) of juice for the family (two of us often have juice for lunch or mid-day snacks as well) in LESS THAN 15 MINUTES!!!! And that includes cleanup.<br><br>The machine is going strong after a year of really tough use and dishwashering of all the parts you need to clean. I like the large juice reservoir (about 3 1/2 c) but wish it were larger. An optional 2 L. reservoir would be nice for power juicers.<br><br>We find starting the day with a big iced glass of fruit/veggie juice has helped us in so many ways....we feel better, we've been able to lose weight, we feel more mental and physical energy. The easy to use Breville has helped us keep with the program. Highly recommended for new juicers, and will be a welcome experience to those who have been hampered by the slow, dreary chore of feeding a mastication style juicer. Give it a try."

    "output": "SKIP THE OTHER MANUFACTURERS AND BUY THIS ONE FOR A DOLLAR OR TWO MORE: For years, I bought a brand name product that is very similar to this Proctor Silex chopper/dicer at the Dollar General store.  Amazon has the same product available here for a $1 or $2 less.  I went through at least 3 of the other brand slicer/dicers in about the same number of years (they even \"improved\" their design).  I also had to return one because it did not work at all (something which raised eyebrows and resulted in me getting some dirty looks - but I figure even if it was just $15, the thing ought to work when you take it out of the box).  SO SKIP THAT BRAND!  This Proctor Silex is wonderful!  It is much easier to align the container, blade, and top -- it is so easy that even when I am not awake, I can't screw up the alignment).  The other GREAT thing about the Proctor Silex is that it only chops once everything is together - you press down on the top - and voila.  The blade is sharper than the other brand and instead of winding up with onion juice or celery juice, I get something much closer to grated onion, celery, carrot, cheese.  I even used it on chopped liver (cooked) and turkey giblets.  Worked beautifully.  I own a 4-cup Proctor Silex drip coffee maker from the early 90s I bought second hand at a thrift store for $2 some 12 years ago.  I figured it would last for a few months, so we bought back-up 4-cup drip coffee makers just in case.  It might not be the most attractive appliance in my kitchen, and you do have to clean it every so often with a little vinegar and hot water, but that Proctor Silex coffee maker has outlasted every other coffee maker I have ever owned.  Now, mind you - I cannot promise but I have a strong feeling that for the extra $2 for this Proctor Silex chopper/grater, you are getting the same quality!  I rate this five thumbs up."

It seems that any fruit or vegetable that is the slightest bit mushy with, an above-average juice content, will cause a backup.  While the backup will usually clear (if you do not add new produce for a few minutes), the machine probably needs  more high-pressure and low-pressure screened area--the screens allow extracted juice to flow out of the machine and in to your collection container.

We are a family of five and was torn between the ten cup and the 5.5.  After I ordered the 5.5 I really felt like I should have ordered the 10 cup, even though I am not crazy about adding more appliances to my limited counter space. Most reviews don't mention how much this cooker will feed.  Well, for my family, we all ate to our hearts content and still had plenty of leftovers.  Given that my kids are all eight and under, we don't need a larger cooker. It was quite a bit of rice that it makes! I can probably feed 7 people easily with this cooker. If you entertain a lot, or eat a lot (hello carbs) I'd go the next size up, not a big price difference. It produced excellent Sushi rice, not burned at all on the bottom, a first for me! I have gone from a fancy $$$ Breville, to an Oster and they all burned on the bottom. This came out perfect from the first try. I recommend this rice cooker, didn't give it a five, because I have not had it long enough to give it a perfect rating. Best appliance I have bought in years. Also, would like to add that it plays a cute tune when it starts the cook cycle. It is a unique appliance."

    "output": "Not a bad juicer but....not that great either: Well, let's start with the pros.1. It makes good juice.2. It cleans up easily3. It is very quiet.The above reasons are why I bought this machine. However, it turns out that these things are not enough for me.The cons:1. EVERYTHING must be chopped before inserting into the ridiculously tiny feed chute.  This didn't sound so bad, all the other reviewers were doing it happily.  Well, I'm here to tell you that it turns making juice into a chore that you will often find you don't want to do.2. One of my motivations for buying this juicer is that I juice a lot of greens, especially lettuce and kale and chard. Supposedly a masticating juicer does this better and gets more juice out than a centrifugal. This has not been my experience. AND you will find that making a head of romaine lettuce into 1.5\" strips and then stuffing them into a little chute is not fun and takes forever. Lettuce bits go everywhere.  And then they get stuck and you have to turn the reverse on or sometimes take it apart to get the clog out. This is because you have to mash them into the chute to get them through.  Sure carrot sticks go through just fine, as do apples and celery but I want more out of my juice than just carrots.3. The juice comes out below the feed chute and the pulp spits out the end of the auger.  This means you need to place two small plastic bowls right next to each other to catch them.  The pulp builds up on the edge of the juice bowl and unless you push it out of the way constantly it falls into the juice.  Plus the bowls are not very big so they fill up quickly if you are making juice for more than one person and you have to stop and empty them while juice drips everywhere. Sure you can put another cup under while you do this to catch the drips but now I have to wash another cup. A small problem but still, I'm a busy person.4. As another reviewer noted, soft fruits don't go through well. Strawberries and pineapples need a lot of coddling.I'm sure some of you who love this juicer are thinking, oh she's a newbie and doesn't understand juicing. This is not so, I have been juicing happily for years with first a cheap Braun and later a more pricey Breville Juice Fountain Elite. I loved my Breville. It made juicing fun and rewarding. After my ex made off with it I figured it was time to get a serious juicer. A masticating juicer. But I'm afraid that it just sucked the fun out of juicing.  I dread the chopping and stuffing and clogging etc.  The worst part is that I spent my juicer budget on this monster and now don't have the cash to buy another Breville which is what I should have done in the first place.So it's a good thing I have a vita-mix and can just go back to making green smoothies all the time instead.  I like to go back and forth between juicing and smoothies because I think they are both good for you.Bottom line, if you are new to juicing, just get a centrifugal and learn from there. Then later, if you want to become a health martyr who suffers for their low-oxidation juice then help yourself to it."

My husband and I went to the Melting Pot for dinner for our anniversary.  Now I have never been to a fondue restaurant so I did not know what to expect.  Needless to say,  I was thoroughly impressed and so in love by the time that we left that I just had to have a fondue pot of my own.  After searching high and low for a fondue pot, I found exactly what I was looking for here on Amazon.  I ordered the fondue pot and it arrived to my house in about 3-5 days.  When it got here I was already prepared with chocolate, crunchy peanut butter, strawberries and marshmallows.  The directions for use are so easy and the recipes are easy too.  My family and I (children included) had a blast dipping our goodies into our chocolate and peanut butter concoction and it was wonderful.  If anyone is in the market for a fondue pot, this is the one.  I guarantee you that you will want to add a second or even a third one so that you can use each for a different item such as cheese, a meat/vegetable broth and one for desssert.  You will not be dissapointed."

This Breville elite is substantial - steel - well weighted bottom- secure cord and easy to clean - I mean very easy and comes with a scrubbing brush - all done within 3 minutes and I'm off. If you're not if you want a slow mulching juicer - omg I would have lost my mind and patience with those - I need something fast and efficient !! I have been juicing celery now for 6 weeks - I wanted better digestion and better skin- I was not prepared for the ELIMINATION OF FIBROMYALGIA !!! That is correct - I have no body pains - It is a joke how much money I have spent on acupuncture and pills and anything that would help me with body pains for 8 EIGHT years!!  Who knew celery juice would be the cure  ? Seriously!! Get the Medical Medium's book - the original one and all the others too. I will be juicing celery for the rest of my life !! So get this juicer and get rid of inflammation in your body. I'll see you at the gym !! Cheers!!"

The unit draws over ten amps so the only switches I had around the house that could handle this was a on/off standard wall switch. 2nd, the cooking plate never sits fully flat and locks in. Picture a plate being supported by a nail. It tilts on all axes depending on whether the weight is centered. And I am not talking a little.. It's looser than my cheating ex. Sadly Presto is now another company that used to make quality but has gone Chinese cheap. I kid you not, in the manual they explain the cord is so short to \"prevent a tripping hazard\"!?!"

Given the non-stick coating, I made to only use materials that would not scratch the surface (I have metal tongs with silicone ends, or I use wooden spoons).  I have cooked a number of things in the grillet, including chicken, steak, burgers, stir fry, and have also used it as a slow cooker.  In every case the food turned out exceptional - the non-stick surface is truly non-stick and the cooking is even (although be careful when using as a slow cooker as the heat coil cycles on and off, rather than steady state like a true slow cooker).  Clean-up is actually nothing short of a miracle - literally rinse with water and wipe with a paper towel.  Feel free to wash it with detergent etc., but not really needed.  The other benefit is that it doesn't heat up the house as much as using a stove or oven.  Overall I was impressed enough to purchase a second one for a mountain condo I own.  HIGHLY recommended"

That would defeat the purpose of having a foodsaver....I also have used this size for freezing homemade chili in single serve portions.  For that, I load the chili into the bag, fold over the top and freeze it for a few hours, then seal it.  I have found that if I am sealing foods that have quite a bit of liquid in them I must freeze it first in the bag, or else the liquid is vacuumed out and no seal can form."

I use the timer with the oatmeal, I set it to start cooking an hour before we get up in the morning and wake up to a hot breakfast!

When I  have ventured beyond white rice, it’s handled quinoa, porridge, mixed rice, and even frozen vegetables with ease. Regardless, it’s more than paid for itself on rice alone. This rice cooker certainly isn’t cheap, but it makes perfect rice every time, keeps the rice warm without drying it out, and is a breeze to clean and store away. It’s never burned the rice on the bottom or boiled over like cheaper cookers, and is still going strong despite regular abuse.

You'll get that perfect cup (note, their \"cups\" are really about 6oz, not a full 8oz) of rice, but it may take an hour.  Using the timer, planning ahead - no problem.  Last minute meal that you want done in 25 minutes - not so good.The only other major issue seems to be the (soldered in) battery.  I have read threads that recommend always leaving the unit plugged in, ostensibly to reduce the battery charge/discharge and hopefully extend the battery life. I'm only a year in on the unit, but will report back in a few years if this strategy helps/hurts.Otherwise, the units works just great and truly makes perfect rice (great steel cut oats as well)."

Last year I purchased a much smaller juicer mainly to make celery juice but it took me like 15 mns to clean, so naturally I used it less and less until I gave it away.I don't give up easily though, so I decided to invest in my health again.My sister has a Breville, so I decided to go for it.This is what my third morning in a row looked like:8:00 am wash celery8:01 Juice a whole bunch (actually in like 30 seconds)8:02 pour in glass and drink it while washing parts8:05 DONE, all parts washed  by hand (I'm pretty sure they go in the dishwasher too).This is an AMAZING machine! It may not be a masticating juicer, and may not get ALL the juice out of the veggies but it's pretty darn close and this one I actually ENJOY using and washing, which makes it better than a higher quality masticating juicer collecting dust in the cabinet!I have also made carrot, apple, pear, ginger turmeric juice (just put the fresh turmeric in first so the rest of the ingredients clean the strong coloring of turmeric)"

This juicer also has a safety lock that secures the top and must be in place before you can start. The only con I have is that its not as compact as I would have liked. I don’t have much counter space but I made it work. I’m still very impressed!"

When we bought our new place, I researched a variety of other brands (and even other models in the same brand). I decided on this one, and I'm once again impressed.  Consistency, great flavor and texture for a variety of types of rice, and fantastic ease of use (that is, once you understand that a \"cup\" is not a standard US cup but, rather, the clear plastic cup (or green plastic cup) that came with the machine).  No regrets at all for not having gotten the even-more-advanced model. I had to laugh when the other day our house cleaner, who's a lovely Chinese lady with super-strong consumer opinions,  complimented me on my choice of this product! She makes rice a lot more than I do and I take this as another confirmation that this rice cooker is a great choice. You'll love the keep-warm feature."

I have never used it as a hot pot, and rarely as a steamer, so I can’t attest to its usefulness there. But for grilling meat, especially chicken, I would highly recommend it.

But sometimes a product has been very helpful to me and sometimes I sort of  think that I should do a review -- it could maybe help somebody else. .  This is the case with this lirttle griddle.  I took it and a small electric hot water pot  in my airplane luggage on what was expected to be a  hard and long trip.  It was.  This little griddle is small and light.I stayed in a place that allowed cooking -- they actually had a  stove, but not a very good one and pots and pans did not come with the room.  Plus this little griddle  gets up to 400 degrees quickly .  Among many other things, it can make a great hamburger. It made my working trip much easier, cheaper and more pleasant.  I'm very glad I had it and I plan to bring it along if there are future trips.  I'm glad I had this little griddle when I needed it.  It worked great."

When you use the pot if you don't select the quick cook - it takes longer - so, buffer in that time for when you should make rice - if you are in hurry, select the quick cook option.I know the music is a bit cheesy but I love it, it sings when it starts and it sings when it's done.  I also liked the looks of the pot, the round and smooth and elongate shape - like alien head - cute!"

Maybe performance varies from one microwave to the other but this one did not work well at all for us. The red version only takes about 3 minutes and leaves very few unpopped kernels. This clear version took about 6 minutes and only half of the kernels popped. Since it took so long the popcorn that did pop had a burnt taste to it.

I previously had a glass popper with a lid on it where you measured the kernels on the lid and then dropped them in. It always left a ton of un-popped kernels and I really mean a lot.I bought this just 2-3 days ago and I've used it three times already and each time I only had 3-4 un-popped kernels in a 1/3 cup. This is the best popcorn popper I have ever had. I've never had so little kernels left in the popper after I was done. The popcorn comes out fresh, hot and delicious and the plastic bowl and lid are simple to clean.It takes me about 2 minutes and thirty seconds to make the best popcorn I have ever made at home. I'm very impressed with this and happy with my purchase and for only fifteen dollars, it's priced very fairly. It comes with a pack of 8 concentrators which you put on the bottom of the bowl. I also bought two additional packs, so I have enough of them to last quite awhile. It's so simple to use and clean as well. I can highly recommend getting this Presto PowerPop if you love to make popcorn at home. I'm sorry I didn't know about this product years ago, but I'm glad I'm enjoying it now."

I like pizza all right, but I very seldom buy a frozen one, and never go to pizza restaurants.  All that aside, I did buy a few different frozen pies at the grocery store after Amazon delivered it.  Instructions were very simple, and it made great pies from frozen.  Great that the pie is visible all the time, unlike in the oven.  Also noticed immediately that unlike cooking a frozen pie in the oven, particular 'supreme' ones, there's no place for messy drips in the oven; if anything melts while cooking it's confined to the pan.  I don't mind at all not having an on/off switch, having owned percolators, popcorn poppers, egg cookers, rice cookers, and a bunch of other small appliances without one.  This is yet another great and relatively inexpensive small appliance from the folks at Presto."

Not only can you make excellent fruit and vegetable juices, you can also make pasta, noodles and breadsticks (and the appliance comes with special nozzles to do it).  It minces, chops, and grinds as well.  You can make nut butters, baby food, grind your own coffee beans and chop nuts for your favorite recipes.It sets up easily and in a jiffy, you do your juice, and it cleans up beautifully in a matter of minutes.  Couldn't ask for more!!!  This is a great little machine for busy people on the go.I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase and this machine deserves the five stars!"

Put the measurements in and walked away to study.  Came back to check on it and what I found was the most perfect rice I've ever made.  I reserve space on my counter for only the most elite efficient appliances and this one has earned a spot.  It is attractive and well designed.  You won't be disappointed.

Customer service told me not to make converted rice in it. I have so much of it that I will try it on the quick setting. It also supposedly makes oatmeal, but not other grains. I want to make risotto in it but have been told that I shouldn’t. I hope it won’t become another expensive appliance I do t use very much.

This new one is a huge disappointment and is headed to the garbage can.  Quality control is sadly lacking.  The thing holding the lower heating element sits too high to allow the lower plate to sit properly - it had to be forced down in order to sit properly but then the clip didn't hold it down.  It kept popping off the plate.  After bending the clip with pliers the clip held but sometimes would bump up against the clip for the upper plate preventing the plates from fitting together to properly.  The few times the clips held, the lower plate browned the waffle nicely but the upper plate did not, ever.  Back to the search for the elusive thin waffle maker."

This liddle dude solves all of that and then some.  You can almost buy two for the price of the larger one and keep the eggs separate from the pancakes when the kids won’t eat em due to a known cross cooking contamination.  Jokes aside, if you had two, eggs on one temp compared to making pancakes on the other giving more control on the cooking.  The integrated drip trough is great as well.  The only improvement I could be picky about is to make a cleaning spatula the shape of the drip trough for collecting and removing drippings so you can keep cooking easily."

    "output": "Makes oil fondues great again!: We used this at Christmas for an oil fondue we use to cook shrimp and filet tips. For the last sooooo many years we had an oil fondue with a fuel burner that just couldn't keep up. No matter what fuel we used it could never maintain enough heat to cook even 2 or 3 items at a time. So I had to keep running back and forth to the kitchen to heat up the oil that would last for a few pieces. I was really unsure how this Cuisinart would do.I am pleasantly surprised and happy to report this thing rocks! We just kept putting in piece after piece and it cooked in no time. I even turned the pot DOWN at one point! Keeping up with our cooking pace was the most important thing so it gets 5 starts based on that alone. I'm not entirely stoked that the unit is an all in one deal, you can't remove the pot from the base, but it's not a huge deal. Other people have recommended the other Cuisinart, the 1000 I think, but based on that fact it sits higher and has the condiment trays. My feeling is that those condiment trays are ugly and I wouldn't want them anyway, and the 3SS sits plenty high enough.Another feature I like is that the connection to the power cord is magnetic. Brilliant idea so that if someone gets tangled in the cord, the pot won't go over. The cord just quickly disconnects, great idea and much safer. Others complain about the bulky nature of the cord, which is somewhat true, but with a full table of plates, food, drinks, etc., I never noticed the cord and I was sitting next to it. The pot inside is non-stock making clean up very easy. It would be nice if it had a ring of condiment cups that looked decent to go along with it. Highly recommend this pot from someone who knows fondue."

This is TOP quality household brand I wanted to try out with Valley Girl to see if it is a brand I want to invest in when I open the shop.  I used this machine yesterday on everything except kale & wheatgrass, leaving those to the masticating machines.The two speeds are both powerful, with high being a bit louder, but oh so much more powerful.  Too fast actually, I juiced everything on low except the ginger.  I got tons of juice out of everything, but on high there was way more oxygen whipped out of it,  it was unnecessary until I got to the ginger.The machine itself is very sturdy and super easy to assemble.  This juicer was easier to clean than my smaller house Hamilton Beach centrifugal juicer and kept strong juicing for 4 hours.  I LOVED IT!!!Fast, medium noise level, a bit heavy but worth it, SO easy to clean, quality juice from every type of produce.  I will post again about this juicer after a few weeks with it...What I juiced yesterday on my Breville:Beets w/ greens,  Carrots, Red Cabbage, Oranges, Red & Green Apples, Pineapple, Cantalope, Lemons, Key Limes, & Ginger"

They “will repair or replace, but it will take several weeks”.  If you get one, use it right away so you can avoid dealing w/them. We weren’t far from the 30 days, but past it, so that was our mistake. I give it a one because they have the order date/info, pics, etc.  Should replace it and have us send this one back.  I’m not happy with the manufacturer & will be avoiding any purchases of Presto products due to their customer service.

I have 5 other juicers, all top of the line, and the 800jexl is hands down the fastest, easiest to use and extracts the highest percentage of juice. Nutrifaster is better but more than $3000. And for the purists who think this machine will overheat the veggies and destroy the enzymes, only 1.5 degrees of temperature rise. No worries here. There are some reviews here that would steer you away but I would have to say that those folks must not follow the guidelines in the manual. The biggest drawback...if you don't do what the book says...is that your juicer will not juice so great. That is because the screen has gotten clogged. Results will be wet pulp. chunks of food, juice spraying out of everywhere, etc. The solution is easy! Keep the screen clean. DO NOT let the juice dry on the screen. Even thought the screen is supposed to be stainless it will clog and then rust almost shut. Clean the screen within minutes of finishing your juicing and it will work like a champ. If you mess up, there ain't no fixing it so go to ereplacements.com and buy a new one for $30."

Not the best solution. I was ready to throw the monster out, but got on this site and read all the reviews first, hoping someone would mention a solution to the problem. And luckily, someone did!  All you have to do is to place the steel steaming tray on top of the pot, with the glass lid on top of that. Presto!  Never have I had another boil over. The glass lid doesn't seal tightly against the pot, thus allowing the boil over messes. The steel tray forms the perfect seal. It would surely be nice if the manufacturer would mention this very important point in the manual, don't ya think?  I now love the pot and have experienced no other problem with it."

    "output": "I'm convinced that this model does not offer the best value in 2015: Having owned this juicer for years, I'm convinced that this model does not offer the best value in 2015.  There are two main issues. The first is that this model currently sells for twice the price of the Breville JE98XL.  The second is that this model often creates a mess due to a design flaw.  The design flaw is not just in my head as fixing it was the single biggest change Breville made when they subsequently designed the JE98XL. The flaw involves the topmost piece of the juicer which consists of the feed chute as well as a large clear plastic piece that forms the ceiling of the juicing area as well as the funnel to the waste bin.  The issue is that this piece does not form a tight enough seal with the metal piece below it.  If you only juice a glass or two of juice, it isn't really an issue.  But I juice a couple days worth of juice at once and before long juice works its way through and starts dripping as well as sporadically spraying through this joint.  This creates such an issue that I am forced to hang cut up produce bags on the wall and cabinet next to where I juice to catch the spray and save me the effort of scrubbing them off when I am done.  In subsequent models, Breville decided to have these two pieces connect by having them overlap each other by 1\"+ which seems to have fixed the issue.  My girlfriend has the JE98XL, which is why I have had the chance to experience both.<br><br>On the plus side, the 800JEXL has a 1000 watt motor.  Breville uses weaker motors in some of its other models (850 watts on the JE98XL).  The difference is noticeable but not meaningful (unless juicing a carrot in 2 seconds instead of 3 is meaningful to you). Also, the 800JEXL uses a lot of steel components which look fantastic and show no signs of wear after a lot of use.  This is superior to the JE98XL which uses steel colored plastic on the exterior.<br><br>In the end, the 800JEXL is a high quality juicer.  But are you really going to pay twice the price for a product that makes a mess when the newer, cheaper, model doesn't?"

My curiosity got the best of me and so I bought it.  Now, if you're like me, one who appreciates the perfect sticky rice, then you'll fall in love with this rice cooker.  I couldn't believe the difference.  It's the perfect stickiness and I cannot help but think it tastes better too.  I'd be shocked if anyone would rate this less than 5 stars.  If you're new to rice, I like Nishiki rice which can also be purchased on Amazon.  Hope this helps.  It was worth every penny."

We've been married for over 27 years, and it isn't that I mind being wrong - I just hate admitting he's right.I was a cook and have been making rice on the stove-top forever. During a dinner party, one of our guests asked why we didn't have a rice cooker. Well... that got my husband researching rice cookers. He read EVERY Amazon.com review as well as the Zojirushi website. You have no idea how bitterly I complained about \"wasting\" money on a rice cooker. Boy was I wrong. This rice cooker is awesome and makes really fabulous rice. Yes, the rice actually is more delectable.Some observations -Similar to coffee makers, the capacity refers to 6 oz cups. However, for best results, Zojirushi recommends using no more than 4 - 6 oz cups of dry rice SO this machine machine comfortably feeds 4 adults. If you plan on feeding more people or want leftovers, consider getting the larger capacity rice cooker.Hands down makes the best brown rice! It comes out perfectly and is delicious! We always knew brown rice was healthier, but just never liked it. Now, it is a regular part of our repertoire.If you've never had rice porridge, you are in for a real treat! You can set the rice cooker up in the evening to have the porridge ready in the morning. We often add thinly sliced black mushrooms and ginger. What a fabulous, healthy warm breakfast.I haven't even touched upon sticky rice or mixed grain recipes. Thus far, everything has come out perfectly. I wish I could say the same of some for my other cooking experiments!So, fair is fair. I'm eating crow and writing this review. I imagine my husband will bookmark this one. Purchasing the Zojirushi Fuzzy Logic Rice Cooker was money well spent. I highly recommend the machine and give it 8 out of 5 stars."

It clearly can't. What you get with a combo of very cold milk, chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce, and malt powder is malted chocolate milk. And that's after following the included instructions to the letter. So, what to do? After mixing your combo up in this device, put the full metal cup in the freezer for an hour. That will approximate what you remember from lo those many years ago.UPDATE: Figured out how to make this produce a milk shake or malt with thicker and more authentic viscosity. Put the desired amount of milk in the metal cup, then put the cup in your freezer for an hour. After you add the ice cream (I zap for 10 secs) and other ingredients, turn the device on Lo and watch the contents closely. It will remain more like a shake/malt if you never turn it on Hi."

The motor base is half the weight of the old one and as a result creeps on the counter when used given the lack of bulk.  The power cord is half the length and borderline too short.  Instruction also warn to not operate for more than a minute at a time to avoid damage to the motor.  The tabs on the cup and switch mechanism in the base do not engage as fluidy as the original Bullet.<br>If you are replacing your old Bullet you will be very disappointed.

Depending on which setting you pick increases or reduces the time in between that it is off.  We set it to a 4 as the ‘optimal’ setting.  The cheese fondue would be cold for about 30 seconds , then burning for 30 seconds, and do that over and over again.  You’ll have to be there stirring it the entire time when it switches the heat back on, or your cheese will burn.  When the cheese is not burning, it gets cold and starts to firm up.Given the above issue, having a double boiler option may solve the problem, but an additional bowl is not included.The set comes with metal fondue forks, but it says you can’t let them touch the inside of the pot or it will scratch the coating.The cord is very short (for safety)"

I have owned several of those because they are cheaper, they all burn out quickly. The omega by far surpassed my expectations. It does take longer but you get more juice. It's quieter. I honestly think either version, masticating or centrifugal, the clean up can be meticulous and time-consuming, but I feel this is actually easier to clean because the film the pulp leaves isn't as prevalent. Also, because the juice does not oxidize you can make extra and keep it in the fridge a few days, so ultimately you save time. If you read other reviews, they will say how you have to cut up the produce more. This is true, but as I mentioned the centrifugal ones just burn up when you put larger pieces in them anyways. And that's just lazy! It's worth the extra effort of cutting the produce down if your taking the time to juice for the nutritional value. This also processes, grinds, and has attachments that you can make pasta and rolls with. Best juicer I ever bought, and I have owned 4."

    "output": "My Favorite Size: I like the bags because you don't have to measure and cut, and only have to seal one side.  I don't like to do anything in the kitchen, so anything that saves time and effort is for me.  You pay more for bags than rolls, but your time is worth something, too.  The pint bag is the one I use most for my husband and me, but I use some quart-size, too.  I have two sealers, a standard size which I seldom use, and an old short one which lives on the back of the counter taking up very little space.  Having it right there ready to use prompts me to use it much more often than if I had to get it out of the closet.  Note:  Your sealer may tell you to wait a certain number of seconds between sealing jobs and to only seal x-number of times at a time to prevent overheating.  Sealing too many things too fast will result in less secure seals.  This is one of the reasons I prefer having to seal only one side of an item, especially as my most common use is to buy big packages of meats and chicken breasts at Costco, seal them all up individually, and put them in the freezer.  This is by far the easiest and most convenient and cost-effective way for me to manage meals at home."

I bought this latest iteration a few years ago. My new wife found the greasiness, etc., of the old one too disgusting. She does not come from a waffle-making family. Obviously.Anyway: they've cost-reduced this design so much it's pathetic. The base is not as heavy as it used to be, giving me the sense that when I raise the lid all the way back, it may tip over. Alan's right that the plates are thinner and warp. The clips that hold the plates don't work as well as they used to.I wish Black and Decker would come out with a \"Toastmaster Classic Waffle Iron\" model that's the way they used to be made and charge $90 or $100 for it.  If they want to keep a lower price point with this overly-cost-reduced model, fine. But give us the Best Waffle Iron in the World Back!!

The Aroma looked a more reasonable size and it was when I received it. So I decided to try it with something simple. I tested how hot it got and the thermometer showed well above the 400 degrees on the dial before it shut off. I thought that was a good sign, I could sear steaks with no problem. So next day I decided to do grilled potatoes and steak. I followed a recipe from the web for this grill. I set it to 400 and added the potatoes rubbed with oil, after a little while I noticed that the slight smoking had stopped so I measured the temp. it was down to 200+ degrees. Now I know that the temp swings attempting to keep a certain temp - but not 200 degrees.  It came back on a little later and moved higher in temp but not to 400. I cooked the potatoes for a while until they showed browning, then I added the steak. I appeared to sear the meat. So when it was done I removed it to a heated plate and added some water to the grill (as per the recipe) replaced the lid and steamed the potatoes. I then plated the potates and steak. I looked OK. However on tasting the meal it tasted heavily of plastic (the non-stick I suspect). Needless to say I am returning this product and will revert to my Jojirushi grill.Stan Graham"

It really takes the juice out and the pulp is so much drier than my old centrifugal juicer.We've been using this several times a day and hubs and I are feeling much healthier.Cleanup is a snap, the parts are easy to remove and put back together.The auger has a metal rod that fits into a metal hole into the motor part of the juicer. This is very important, because if it were made of plastic, the life of the juicer would be questionable at best.I've juiced soft items like papaya and honeydew, they tend to clog a bit, but if you take the plunger and pull it up and down in the feeder hole, the juice comes out. Or if you use a harder item, like carrots afterward, it'll push out what gets stuck inside. It's not a big deal at all.The juice comes out cold if the fruits and veggies have been refrigerated before juicing them. It was never cold when it came out of my centrifugal juicer.This is such an excellent deal. I'm glad I found out about masticating juicers and this one is great for the price, free shipping can't be beat. It arrived quickly and the packaging is great.If you are looking for a great juicer with a very moderate price tag, this is the one."

However, the variety of functions and the keep warm function have sold me. It takes some commitment if you want to explore all the ways to use it, but you really won't be sorry. I have some limited mobility because of health issues, and I can put supper together in the morning, while I feel good, and then by evening, when I don't feel so well, it is all waiting for me. I am satisfied my money was well spent. I do recommend getting a good rice cooker cookbook, such as the \"Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook\" by Hensperger and Kaufman, to go with it. And no, I don't get any kickback. I just have gotten lots of good ideas from it. I especially like the Hagai Mai rice I've cooked in it."

Bought it mostly for homemade bread and Costco sourdough bread, which tends to be a dense and sticky bread with a hard crust. This electric knife is absolutely terrible at cutting that kind of  bread. The blade seems very dull to me, and flimsy. It is also difficult to remove the blade for cleaning - you have to struggle with it and risk getting cut. Back it went. in contrast, I have been using my trusty Henckel's serrated bread knife for the last 25 years and, as it turns out, it is working just fine! So, I am going to stick with the old tried and true non-electric serrated bread knife. Plus, nothing to break or plug in. It just works."

I have had a waffle plate fall on top of the bottom one twice while heating.When I used the griddle flat, the plates slide around when you try to flip pancakes etc, exposing the coils which are hot.I really had wanted what I thought would be a versatile product.  Instead I find I spent a lot of money on a product I am afraid to use because of the danger of being burnt by falling or sliping grids.  Please note that I double check that the plates are held securely each time, but the mechanisms are just not tight no matter what I do with it.The plates also discolored on the griddle side with high heat and it did not hold the temperature well.  It took forever to make pancakes."

Cleaning is horrible as a result where the lid has a tiny space where all the rice water accumulates and the rice cooker is sprayed with the escaped steam & rice starch. I would not recommend this design and brand for a rice cooker. New design is with a closed lid and with a space plate to mitigate the escaped steam and splatter.If you don’t cook rice too much but would like to complement you Cuisinart kitchen gadgets it would be your decision to look pretty for open house etc. But this is really not for frequent cooking rice given the time to clean up after it."

The front piece where the popcorn comes out is so wide that a very large bowl is needed to catch all the popcorn. The heat blower is so strong that the unpopped kernals come out of the spout super fast and are also extremely hot.

First thing I find out is when you flip the plates over from griddle to waffle the clips will not hold the bottom plate in place because there isn't enough room for the electric stuff underneath. If you eventually get it mashed down enough to stay in place and try to heat it up, the expansion from heating again pops the bottom plate out of the clips. If you do try to make anything in it the waffle will be brown on one side and barely done on the other. Definitely not worth spending the money on."

It’s perfect for 1-2 people (or for traveling) and doesn’t take up a lot of counter space. I have noticed after such consistent use that there is a dark ring on the face, but it still cooks things just fine! Would definitely recommend!"

If you follow instructions, which are really easy in general, then you cannot go wrong. It has many great features and it is really simple to operate. The timer cooking is very convenient and very useful. The most amazing thing is that when it is done cooking rice it goes into the keep warm state and I have left rice in the cooker for 3 hours after it is done cooking and it is still perfect when you get it out. I mean that is really impressive."

I joked that the remaining pulp was going to waste - or did I have to eat it.  To my surprise she used it in a bread and it was great so there is a way to make use of all of the material from most things.  This is a well built and great looking machine.  We have had other juicers but this one is by far the best."
